"One important correction about this vid. Anonymous is/was not a centralized hacker group with any leadership, like this man alluded to. The very point of the ‚ÄúAnonymous‚Äù movement was that anyone could be ‚ÄúAnonymous‚Äù. Any hacktivist group could act behind the guy fawks mask as long as it was done with good faith, fighting for a ‚Äúgood‚Äù cause. That‚Äôs what initially made it work, and ultimately made it fail. If anyone tried to hack let‚Äôs say a children‚Äôs hospital for ransom and hide behind the mask, they would paint a target on their backs and put them selves in the crosshairs of the rest of the movement.

ISIS was originally AQI which was a cia project in iraq. Jabhat al Nusra Front was a mossad project. isis og leader bahgdadi was identified as a mossad agent. HTS was exposed at the end of the last syrian war as just isis with a different mask. israel ran logistics and medical aid for isis and nusra front during the syrian civil war. nusra front helped mossad take over golan heights so israel could move the fence again. the free syrain army and all the other named rebel groups were just isis but used different names so they could get support from the usa and eu. everytime a newly trained rebel group crossed into syria they instantly claimed allegiance to isis. syrain rebels used chemical weapons on civilians multiple times in an attempt to get the usa to join the battle but failed when they filmed themselves doing the chemical attack and posting it on the internet for hundreds of thousands to see and exposing their lies. the old leader of HTS and the new syrian leader is an isis terrorist with a 10 million dollar bounty still on his head by the fbi. the only thing the fall of assad accomplished was guaranteeing another 10 years of bloodshed and war in syria and it gives the jews and the saudis what the want with zero shits given to humanity. ive been watching this closely for the last 14 years.,[],2024-12-16T20:29:07Z,@gemstonehiphop

Isis is a deviation, They killed more Muslims then anyone else. it manipulates young muslims who may be ignorant or their actual fiath to push its violent unislamic agenda by branding themselves as Muslims they got access to a large number of young people who are Muslims then indoctrinated them into something that has nothing to do with Islam. It's a deviant cult.

Killing anyone is against Islamic Sharia Law. You can only kill if it is self-defense and the other person is trying to kill you. Did isis look like self-defense?  

In islam during war, assuming you are a Muslim nation,  you are not allowed to harm trees, women, children, monks(priests), elderly and non combatants.  Did Isis look like that to you?

I'm telling they are not the following islam. Rather, they are creating their own cult.","['ŸáŸÖ ÿµŸÜÿπŸàŸáŸÖ ÿßÿµŸÑÿß', ""it's ok bro, I get you.

"This may not have been what the video was about, but it is important. To have eternal life, to escape hell, do not to try to do religious deeds and reform yourself morally. It's like offering a bribe to God to clear you of your bad deeds, because a good work will not clear bad deeds, like in any court. If you‚Äôve so much as lied and stolen you already stand as a liar and thief before God. The Bible states that the wages of sin is death, but that the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ. This is God‚Äôs mercy: Most people know Jesus died on the cross 2,000 years ago, but many may not consider that He paid for our fine of death. We broke God‚Äôs law, Jesus paid our fine on the cross. He rose from the dead 3 days later, and all that you have to do to have eternal life and to be saved from hell is that while you should of course turn from your sins, the only thing to help you is to repent to God, to trust alone in what Jesus did for you on the cross rather than trying to make your own way to God. If you would turn to Jesus and trust Him, you will be saved from hell and eternal death. It's not about joining a religion or trying to earn it, but just turning to God and being given mercy because of what He did for you. Why can you go to heaven? Because Jesus paid for your sins already and will clear your case when you simply trust Him to save you. Jesus said that He is the Way, Truth, and Life, and that nobody goes to the Father otherwise. There‚Äôs no other way about it. The validity of this promise is clear through the prophecies of the Bible being fulfilled throughout the years with many being fulfilled now, with one example being in the nations coming against Israel in the current day such as Iran, Russia (which really wasn‚Äôt much of a developed or powerful area at the time), and Turkey among others being predicted in the book of Ezekiel.",[],2024-12-13T07:24:36Z,@BearClaws94258

"Isis sounds more the prophet Muhammad than most muslims. I am unsure in what way they are not muslims. 

Muhammad tortured a man with fire so does Isis. 

""Muhammad‚Äôs order to torture Kinana ibn al-Rabi with fire, as recorded in multiple historical sources, highlights the Prophet‚Äôs willingness to use coercive measures to achieve his goals, including extracting information about treasure. This event serves as a reminder of the complexities and controversies surrounding Muhammad‚Äôs life and teachings.""


He also encouraged the killing of hypocrites which Isis does. If anyone isn't serious about Islam they want to kill them.

Surah An-Nisa‚Äô 4:88: This verse instructs believers to deal with hypocrites as enemies, unless they repent and amend their ways. It says: ‚ÄúThose who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and among the polytheists, never will they cease to be hostile towards you until you fortify yourselves against (attack from) them and (your) faith becomes strong. But many among them are defiantly obstinate. So do not relent (in your duty) and invoke (the help of) Allah for your guidance.‚Äù

Surah Al-Tawbah 9:56: This verse describes the characteristics of hypocrites, including their fear of being killed by the believers, and their tendency to swear allegiance while secretly plotting against the Muslims.

‚ÄúO Allah, I declare war against those who declare war against Thee, and those who disobey Thee, and those who sever the ties of kinship, and those who are hypocrites.‚Äù

Declaring anyone who opposes them as disbelievers, declaring their own ppl as disbelievers if the commit sin which is absolutely WRONG. If their predecessors declared Ali (may Allah ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßŸÜŸá Ÿà  ÿ™ÿπÿßŸÑŸâ be pleased with him) and his followers as disbelievers then they would have no problem declaring any other muslim as such. They have such arrogance, they talk sweetly but their actions say otherwise. They are the khawarij.

Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ‚ÄúThere will be division and sectarianism in my nation, and a people will come with beautiful words and evil deeds. They will recite the Quran, but it will not pass beyond their throats. They will leave the religion as an arrow leaves its target, and they will not return to it as the arrow does not return to its bow. They are the worst of the creation. Blessed are those who fight them and are killed by them. They call to the Book of Allah, but they have nothing to do with it. Whoever fights them is better to Allah than them.‚Äù

"outsiders and the media always describe 4chan like almost a dark web forum where in reality it's just an imageboard forum with free speech although it's full of weirdos

people who are ""regulars"" on 4chan aren't just one specific group. 4chan is essentially a forum where people with different ideologies and interests gather. although, the most well known ones are the right wing ones. different boards have different topics like 

/b/ which doesn't really have any topic so you can discuss anything you want. most users come here.
/pol/ (politically incorrect). mostly right wing people. occasionally you can find leftists here and there but leftists on 4chan don't easily get offended like liberals in your local college campus. /pol/ users were the ones who trolled Shia Labeouf's HWNDU streams.
/mu/ is the place to discuss music. Anthony Fantano's early career is pretty much just talking about whatever people on /mu/ listen to and recommend

some things that 4chan did aren't even right wing, in fact, it was a response to racism, like the ""Pool's Closed"" where they trolled Habbo Hotel because the moderators showed discrimination against black people's characters in the game.

Really do wish their was a hybrid between 4chan and Reddit. Got my 6th or so account banned on r/Pics... post about Trump of course. Was simple front page as it showed his bad orange makeup by how white his ear was... basically a picture of his ear. I said something sassy but they deleted it so I couldn't even know what it was...

probably like ""I bet reddit can't wait to see that ear get shot again."" Wish is just true. Got banned for ""Threatening Violence."" Cool.  Power mods ruin the sight... idc if it leans left... just don't be radically left.

Recall losing well over a hundred portraits of redditors, there is a sub where you draw random people and it is good art practice, because I posted ""A Call To Action"" and ""A Call to Action II"" in r/latestagecapitalism about how the revolution will be televised. Most knew it was satire where they were the joke but there was a good few people excited, kids going ""I really hope this is real.""

I was banned for Ableism. For I said ""Calling all able bodied men of military age to take up arms and meet me at the fortification to prepare for Project Mayhem.""

I mean I could have been banned on the grounds of sexism or ageism just as well. Or idk... calling people to arms? Calling for insurrection? That wasn't the problem though.

'Well, maybe there's a third one? Where could the next one be? Should I stay home? Are there any people I know there?' The thoughts that come to your mind then are unexplainably scary, especially the feeling that you're unprotected, unsafe.

"The Syrian Arab Republic effectively ceased to exist today as of December 8th. Assad fled. I know he was a mass murderer and I cannot stand behind him at all, but before the war happened, Syria was in order and Muslims could peacefully coexist. Now that Syria has fallen, I think ISIS-like groups will come back again. I'm afraid Europe and perhaps even America will be affected soon after and should start making preparations, because, with the all-time low stability in Syria, disaster is bound to happen. It's only a matter of time before the power vacuum will be taken advantage of. Extremists would only focus on the region for a while, but as we saw here, these groups can easily recruit troops all over the world. I hope I'm wrong, but we must be careful. I have my opinion on the coalition too, but I'd rather stay quiet about it before they think I'm a sympathizer of the Russians and Assad.

No. I disagree. They absolutely were and still are harmless jokes and depictions. If anything it's you who has been misled to believe that calling it an innocent joke is not ok.

"Saying a cartel in Mexico is 'powerful' is a very relative term.

A much better way of viewing them is as enabled. The cartels are able to do quite a lot and get away with it, which is actually why they're intensely violent. The La Costra Nostra crime family on the east coast, by comparison, is much less so. Not because they don't want to be, but because they know if they are they'll all be taken down.

In other words, it's less that the cartels are very powerful, and more that the Mexican government is very weak. They are heavily understaffed, sometimes even out-armed, and rife with corruption.

It's like saying a 9 year old able to eat whatever he wants is powerful. It's not as if the child is so powerful they get to decide what they can eat, but rather that they have very permissive parents",[],2024-09-06T06:46:06Z,@charliebeareuwu

"This story serves to show the reason why the mexican government even if it wanted too does not. Even if the government decided to tackle the root cause, the loss of life would be inmmense. There are many few presidents who have had the balls to wage war to the cartels. Felipe Calderon, although heavily criticized, is a politician who aspired to do this. He is very much unpopular in Mexico because of his war against the cartels that was not only difficult, but had tremendous loss of life. The war was a failure. His efforts were more undercredited since there was much evidence of his military efforts focusing on specific cartels while not touching others. Either way like him or hate him, Felipe Calderon sticks in my mind as the only politican who could see the dimension of the drug problem in Mexico, and concluded that bringing them war is the only solution. A belief which I also hold firm. If the Mexican government cannot reign in these criminals, eventually other more powerful governments like our abusive partner up North will move in and do the job for us, and it wont be done for the goodness of their hearts, but to protect american interests, and pacify their neighbor which is becoming everyday more of a threat to their nation.",[],2024-09-04T19:00:23Z,@LosLeonesLibrary

"I'm extremely anti-war and anti-oppression, but... here's an idea. Have America take over Mexico (for some time, until proper restructuring).
- Make their government a democracy.
- Restructure worst/non-working parts of their government.
- Fix worst laws to always allow basic human rights. Make their country/way of life decent-enough where there's far more incentive for their citizens to want to continue living there, instead of illegally entering America.
- Fix law enforcement (laws and agents). Low offences for minor crimes, intermediate offences for intermediate crimes, and extreme offences for extrme crimes.
- End all cartels (military force always prevails). No negotiating with terrorists/savages.
- End all government corruption (somewhat an oxymoron as America has this too).
- Work to spread democracy, equality, freedom, other good qualities to other nations/territories.
- America 'leaves', but is always on standby to help its 'brother'.

Soy extremadamente anti-guerra y anti-opresi√≥n, pero ... aqu√≠ hay una idea. Haga que Estados Unidos se haga cargo de M√©xico (durante alg√∫n tiempo, hasta que la reestructuraci√≥n adecuada).
- Haz de su gobierno una democracia.
- Reestructurar las peores/no trabajadoras de su gobierno.
- Arregle las peores leyes para permitir siempre los derechos humanos b√°sicos. Haga que su pa√≠s/forma de vida sea decente, donde hay mucho m√°s incentivos para que sus ciudadanos quieran continuar viviendo all√≠, en lugar de ingresar ilegalmente a Estados Unidos.
- Arreglar la aplicaci√≥n de la ley (leyes y agentes). Delitos bajos por delitos menores, delitos intermedios por delitos intermedios y delitos extremos por delitos extrme.
- Termine todos los carteles (siempre prevalece la fuerza militar). No negociar con terroristas/salvajes.
- Termine toda la corrupci√≥n del gobierno (algo un ox√≠moron como Estados Unidos tambi√©n tiene esto).
- Trabajar para difundir la democracia, la igualdad, la libertad, otras buenas cualidades para otras naciones/territorios.

American intelligence cant really deal with drug cartels in mexico since 1980 because there is a very strong goverment participation involved.

It doesnt matter who or what kind of ppl try to mess with them, if ur american and if u put a single foot on mexico and they KNOW WHO YOU ARE you will be hunted down to death (even be viscerally killed).

Maybe this sounds pretty exagerated for a dumbass civilian (internet user) who never made it out the north, south, west or east side of the united states territory, but this is a death sentence for any deployed agent or military infiltration here, and, it started with the Camarena incident.

Not only mexican cartels kill each other in gruesome ways, same apply for captured agents or military infiltrators who mess with them, and, it doesnt matter what cartel, crime organization, government or business sphere youre in, if they know ur passing info to the other side, ur really really dead.

"8:53, Unless the Anonymous OPSEC is horrible, this would be impossible for the cartel to do.

Considering Anonymous has a massive powerbase, they could host the backend of their servers hosting the sites displaying the information that Los Zetas doesn't want to be seen in practical invisibility, especially if they leveraged TOR. Hell, if they managed to hack a DB containing the information of any of the Los Zetas members or used a RAT of some kind, they could also blacklist their IP from connecting, making it impossible for them to even see the webpage (could be easily bypassed by going somewhere else to connect though).

"DAILY WIRE LEAK: Advertisers Are Walking

A current employee at the Daily Wire has come forward and said that the Daily Wire is struggling with both views and advertisers.

From the source:

‚ÄúThe recent ‚ÄòBack Stage Live at the Ryman‚Äô event was a disaster from start to finish‚Äù.

According to that same source, the Daily Wire couldn‚Äôt sell tickets so they asked all employees to attend and bring their friends and family.

‚ÄúAt least 70% of the audience that attended were made up of colleagues, friends and family.

Executives made a decision to not air the event live on YouTube for fear that the public would see the empty seats.

They instead edited the event and released it onto YouTube the following day‚Äù. 

Even the edited event was a colossal failure.

Just 5k viewers watched it live despite heavy advertising. 

‚ÄúAdvertisers are unhappy.

We‚Äòve already lost millions in ad sales this year.

It feels like the company is in a state of managed decline.‚Äù

Looks like the Daily Wire overplayed their hand when they revealed that they truly were an Israel First media outlet.",[],2024-08-16T17:20:21Z,@someguy6924

I'm convinced that Anonymous is the actual CIA or government in disguise making the people feel like they already have a hero. It's kind of obvious when Anonymous never goes after the true and ultimate conspiracy of a new world order he only goes after an exposed the lowest men on the totem pole like things that would never affect the ultimate goal of a new world order. It's brilliant that people think they have this Anonymous hero that has the ability to take people down that are extremely corrupt. But yet he never ever actually gets down to the nitty and gritty of the real scary conspiracies. Anonymous is like qanon he gives you a bunch of Truth muddled with a bunch of bullshit and then only goes after the lowest man on the totem pole and nothing ever actually gets done. They string you along making you think that they will eventually expose all the corruption but they never do. They just keep telling you it's coming but it never does.,['On top of that Anonymous was incredibly silent during the covid-19 World takeover when extreme tyranny was imposed on the entire world.

"Maybe Taylor has DID. And one of her more mischievous alters is a 4Chan fan.

The song I Hate It Here is a true love üíó story about an alter who does not like to front and her love (finance guy). It is also meant to be a duet, as some lines are clearly the guy's (debutant and the more masculine ‚ôÇ inner world with things like lunar craters)

It also implies the narrating alter can make the system say things without fronting. Which would explain why she sometimes acts weird in a way like she is about to say something but changes last second. The strongest alter prevents information they don't want said to be said.

Though, the thing with more evidence is she has the unusual ability to go into a trance like state and have her Unconscious 

She could have that ability and DID though.

"This video due to reasons unknown had a surprisingly ~plenty felt psychological impact on me. Like near the end of the video still shots and clips with Taylor on them were scary for me and I couldn`t look at them directly without anxiety. Why would that be? No idea... Also after a friend introduced me to reddit a long time ago I weren`t particularly impressed (just another site I thought and honestly still think, popularity aside, and occasional alleged usefulness, even if I haven`t actually found a working solution for PC related, software wise, problem ~ever... I have found some reassuring things that I am at least ""not alone""... like when Easy Anti Cheat had problems with my old AMD CPU and could load the game I were (and still am) playing at the time ~once without PC restart... and that PC had a very... very... very slow time also due to... IDK... reasons... So possibly for about half an year every time I got disconnected, or PC needed to reset due to some reason... it was horrible... I found out other people have the same problem with that particular Anti Cheat software in other games and I were also in an on going back and forward communication with the support staff of the game I were having troubles with playing... and surprisingly, well maybe not half an year but like ~idk 3... or 4 months or 6 latter... they did actually manage to fix it with that CPU... I was year(s plural) later that I got a new PC and if it weren`t for that fix, IDK how I would have dealt with it. And 4Chan is older than reddit and I also knew about it of another friend (oh yeah I did have a period where I were browsing Reddit, but because my even older PC that was relocated on sort of a work place could mostly do just that +/- NFS Shift, Darksiders and Portal. But it got kind of sort of... very boring) but it was very long ago and also didn`t particularly impressed me to the point I become a fan.. maybe it wear off on me the same way reddit did latter on. I used to like ~forums... on specific topics and specific forums... also another site I remember I used to like was by a single person named Madox (or something... he used to have good solo ""works"") Those collective meme things... Speaking of Memes... I do like the Meme Clips @ 7 p.m. British time (if you get which ones I mean), but just those of their ""menu"". So what were I talking about... oh yeah... something about Taylor Swift... soo erm... since I will most likely to maintain any sort of coherence, if we assume I did this fire (which I didn`t)... My next statement is QTCinderella. That`s what I were thinking about during this entire clip. Was an interesting clip... But idk... there should have been some sort of mentioning of QTCinderella... All I wanted to share was how I somehow have missed... am missing all this 4Chan not only remains a thing but also actually really >is< a thing... to the point where it`s community augments world wide online votes and such... I wonder who would win a vote pool of straight up 4Chan versus Reddit... one or the other must have more votes in the end of the day... I wonder if that`s been done... but I think in 2024 you just have to also involve twitch.tv QTCinderella in Taylor Swift talks... Or am I mistaken?

The other side of it is though that if the school thought that the kids would still enjoy it even if the means of it coming around were less than savory I think she should have went through with it, but also did a concert at the second place as well because it was cheated so I don't think second place should have been punished either.",[],2024-05-31T08:45:18Z,@Etheoma

Then the 2000's and 2010's came in when the left forced ""because fuck you that's why"" to be a mainstream political opinion. They're still not able to understand the sentiment because, despite over a century of evidence that they're a malignant evil, they still, somehow, think they even count as human beings and fail to see they're subhuman scum.","['Interesting point that this thought was equipped to leftist politics by 4chan. In the video, the claim is made that there is a repressive (or malignant) force exercising power to some end. However, there is significantly more engagement on the internet now. 4chan may have been disorderly or disorganized, but the cohesion of many diverse groups of people on 4chan was linked to a common goal of maintaining freedom and sometimes privacy.

"I was there from around 2005 to Chanology. You're understanding of the origins and nature of ""Anonymous"" in relation to 4chan isn't correct. ""Anonymous"" wasn't formed as a distinct group of hackers; rather, it's a label derived from the default posting name on 4chan. When users posted without choosing a specific handle, their posts were attributed to ""Anonymous."" This became a sort of collective identity, especially during various online movements or activities.

The concept of Anonymous evolved over time. While it's true that some members were skilled hackers, the _vast_ majority were just regular users or ""script kiddies"" with limited technical expertise. Their strength lay more in their collective action rather than advanced technical skills. This unified action allowed even simple tools, like the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (L.O.I.C.), to be used effectively in large-scale coordinated efforts, often overwhelming targets with sheer volume of traffic or actions. This type of activity became particularly notable during events like Project Chanology.

"Websites like these are the last places where things feel genuine. Self-awareness while trying to find your own small role and not interacting with others' roles except when necessary just made everything else feel childish and pointless. Like there was nothing before and will be nothing afterwards. ""Things have always been bad"" is a position of strong wisdom, but is instead an aesthetic now that connects to nothing but a necessary part of routine. That's how these websites see modern teenagers. They are saying that politics shouldn't be reduced to simple emotional processes, but instead treated as the highest point and result of being aware of those emotions. And when you get an understanding of that, it shouldn't be reduced back into a simple idea that's just in a better place to do more good. It should go back to the grand worldview, being beyond the abstractions, being able to accept that we are all just birds looking at screens to put it lightly, and then using this attitude for good. Being able to hate the ideas but respect their deepness and strength behind them. That's what these websites mean for people, whether or not it leads to something good, it allows us to understand truly important things in a way where failure isn't important. And if things are insane, some equally insane force is needed to push them in the right direction",[],2023-11-28T15:33:54Z,@–¢1000-–º1–∏

The lack of free speech is what destroyed the Soviet Union because the lies upon lies said to protect the fragile egos of children could no longer bear the weight of the unbreakable laws of the universe. 

Declaring that no graphite was on the ground because graphite being on the ground would embarrass the State is the reason the State ceased to exist when it chose to ignore the truth, and reality didn't care. It irradiated the State all the same.

"the only reason you may have a negative reaction to 4Chan is because you allowed the media to condition you to react that way. They told you it was bad- because 4Chan is kicking their butt. Now they have half the population of the world convinced its a Nuremburg rally when in reality its capable of being a ridiculous collaboration of people unfettered by the constraints of the safe, corporate and restricted world. 

Take for example the missile strikes on obscure compounds in Syria- 4Chan users were triangulating the height of telephone poles and cross referencing with google maps to pinpoint camps. Shia LeBoeuf tried to display a flag as a political statement and within hours it had been found, taken down, spammed with laser pointers etc. each time he moved it and restarted a 24/7 stream, it was found within hours by these people just working together with sun angles, shadows, street noise, aircraft contrails in the sky behind it and comparing to flight routes. 

And yes, you get the amusing situation at times where the guy with the swastika profile photo can have an eloquent and well thought out debate with a guy using the N-word as a conjunction and both come away from it for the better. For some reason, everyone on 4Chan is capable of punctuation, spelling and grammar- whereas some of the stuff you see from the college educated blue checkmark crowd is rife with run on sentences, typos and arguments with more holes than a collander.

"The problem is that the free speech situation is much more complex than it seems. People always had the right to believe whatever they wanted and spread it as far as they could get. But with the internet bullshit and hate are allowed to spread like wildfire and in most cases not for the improvement and benefit of society.

Following this kind of train of thought is very dangerous as most people certainly don't know what to do with their ""freedom"" In fact I doubt that they even grasp the concept of freedom and what it entails.

The fact that the most despicable things have emerged from the internet as a fight for ""freedom of speech"" shows how dangerous is to allow people to spread nazi and other hateful beliefs. 
I saw firsthand the growth of nazism and libertarian ideas once people who identified with such ideas felt safe to spread their bullshit. And no matter what anyone would say, you can't give free speech to people who don't respect other people's freedom.

On the other hand, we have the assinine spread of misinformation and pseudo-science which are at least terrible for the general knowledge of mankind and at worse capable of endangering human lives and even the planet, with people spreading anti-vax bs, people denialism over climate change and other things.

A couple of years ago maybe I would defend the freedom of speech at any cost, but now considering the aspects I pointed out above, I think that doing it is akin to putting a gun in a child's hand, it would do no good for the child as they could not use to defend themselves and given enough time they would blow their heads by accident because them don't know how to properly use it.",[],2023-07-14T20:56:18Z,@raphaelcalado4335

* Cockmongler (A picture of a man with a crazed grin, taken from the website of a tourist attraction. Frequently paired with the threat: ""I'LL SUCK YOUR COCK!"")
* Happy Negro (A picture of a man from a pornographic video making a comical expression of exagerrated joy while squeezing a woman's breasts)
* Teh Rei (A piture of a penis with blue hair and a face drawn on it in mspaint, so yeah, by about the third 4chan meme ever memes were already becoming a vehicle for meta commentary on the arbitrary nature of memes)
* Milhouse Is Not A Meme (A series of memes expanding upon the above theme depicting Milhouse from The Simpsons desperately trying to become a 4chan meme.)
I probably forgot some or fucked up the order a bit, and there were a lot of imported memes from 2chan too (such as Sageman.)

"This is an unintentionally malicious video. To you, someone trying to make a living by doing what you love - making youtube videos, you saw something semi interesting that might generate clicks and thought ""Hey I might google about this ""fooouuur chan"" and see what it's about, make a video about it"". Everything you said in this video is just a veil 4chan uses. The two words at the heart of those at 4chan who do all these things that have real life consequences, are ""ESCALATE"" and chaos. The entire current situation of American politics is just an elaborate scheme orchestrated by 4chan. The ""Left vs Right"" isn't an actual state of the American people. 4chan has for over a decade now worked hard on something known as ""black propaganda"". Over 70% of the memes and main talking points of the ""left"" today are derived from a piece of black propaganda 4chan injected into society. 

Thinking 4chan's power is limited to something miserable like trolling scientology, it's exactly what 4chan wants. Ever since the tumblr war, and a bit before that, 4chan was reminded federal attention isn't something they can take. So most of the movement nowadays is done by old veterans who can understand the layers upon layers of camouflage the relevant posts have.

Of course, all of these things are something you won't find with a ""quick google search"", which is what most of this video is based on.",[],2023-06-12T19:02:50Z,@deaansugee

I agree even the worst speech need to be protected though slurs and spam constantly is more annoying then shocking or anything.

4chan on the other hand is the kind of place where you can truly say what you think, provided you maintain a certain level of behaviour you could go on for hours, what's is more, you could find a strong divergence in opinions without anyone trying to bring some artificially enforced peace, I like the idea of people saying things not because they want psychological validation, but because that's what they truly believe, believing in what you think is truth is more important than popularity, that's the basis of sciences and good management, to say what you feel is truth even if it goes against what most people think.",[],2023-04-26T20:50:55Z,@commandermcnash5137

"Yawn, hate to burst your bubble buy this ""free expression"" and ""free speech"" is coded jargon for doing and saying something with no accountability and responsibility. Just because you are ""anonymous"" (let's be honest, there is no such thing as being anonymous when it comes to online activity) does not give one the right to do and say anything they want without consequences. Your right is to do or say what you wish... and others rights are to do the same (which means if someone doesn't like your actions or comments, they have the right to say so). What ""deplorables"" (and really societal rejects on both sides) fail to comprehend is what you are against is actually what keeps society civil. The #1 attribute that causes decay of a society is lack of civility. Trolling, disrespectful zingers, hacking, and cyber bullying are not being civil or protecting free speech. These are actions of people who are lashing out due to rage... 100% opposite of a civil society.

"This video is more than a bit self-congragulatory and self-important.  Yes, freedom of speech is sacrosanct, but 4-chan is more about hiding behind a shield of anonymity to say horrible things consequence free.  If it's important for anything it shows us how people truly feel deep down in the nastiest parts of their brains.  I'm not sure that's to be celebrated among the many benefits of ""free speech"".  Don't mistake the concept of free speech with consequence-free speech.  There are social, ethical, and moral aspects to what people say, and even though you are perfectly free to say whatever you like, one of the costs can be people think you are an asshole and dont want to listen to you (an example of their freedom).  By hiding, these ""trolls"", or maybe ""cowards"", can preserve their social standing while acting like total dicks.  And one would hope that social outcasts who are bullied would know better, but when anonymity strips away the consequences they show they are every bit as bad as the bullies they hate.

"the enlightenment wasn't about free speech. the west never had free speech. yes the philosophers may have argued for it. but the argument was contextual. liberalism was always racially, and class-wise, and gender-wise, seggregated. It was a tool used by the emerging elites of the post-feudal society to establish their dominance in the new world order they created. yes, liberalism then went on to enable colonized people, and working class people, and women and lgbt people a vocabulary to establish their rights, but it too was made possible by material changes. 4Chan unfortunately gave power to a group of people who had the ability to speak without accountability hidden behind anonymity and enables the years of progress on gender and racial rights to be upended, because the corporate elites had started appropriating it for their gains in the media. Make no mistake, that the 'wokeness' of corporate media is a result of actual political gains made through years of organising and fight against oppression, stiffling of free speech, and democracy, often perpetrated by the very media that later embraced it. So to give in to the idea that 4Chan represented a backlash against elites, as if those ideals were elite driven and top-down, is dangerous and disingenous. Those so called corporate ideals, which btw are very cosmetically adopted by the corporat elites, aren't actually corporate ideals but ideals emanating from the struggle of common poor people, ostracised by society and years of hard fought gains. 4Chan's existence notwithstanding, its ability to amplify and provide a safe space for the disenchanted largely white male middle class youth, is not something to celebrate but to look at with concern because at some level they're just a backlash against rising equality and loss of privilege. If corporate ideals are what is the heart of the problem here, then why aren't 4Chan's threads articulating the struggles of migrants and black people, who are still majorly poor, under insured, and under employed, or why aren;t trans people and the LGBT folks, whose mental health records are still abysmally low finding 4chan as a place for communing with their fellow outcasts.

"I'm really late for the party and mainly writing this as a way to organize my thoughts so... 
There are some very good points here, but it's genuinely hard to tell if you're being naive or disingenuous(is that the word?) at some parts.
I have a hard time believing for example the proposal of Donald fucking trump being the face of something you define having anti-establishment as a core value. And pretending 4chan somehow represents society as a whole against powerful people, ignoring the multiple instances where it actively is used to punch down along with the very extensive history of doxxing and harassment campaigns, specially on minorities. It just seems a little sheltered to believe 4chan to be a representative of the little guy when, to me, it seems more like a representative of a very specific type of people who consider themselves the little guy.
The whole bastion of free speech last hope thing is a tad dramatic but then again it's an YouTube video, it's just really strange with my experiences to look at the whole thing and try to convince myself that this is the best we can do as a society. I'm all for free speech but there's a great gap between ""I want to express my political views and I'm being censored"" and ""They won't let me call people slurs :("", as I see it the responsibility part is still missing from the equation. You can't make a place welcoming for extremists, white supremacists, incels and any other exclusionary group and then pretend this place will also be welcoming to anyone to express themselves. Fear of retaliation is also an obstacle of free speech, a community can do censorship better than a plataform itself ever could. It is hard to distinguish them from a Twitter angry mob canceling someone, if anything sometimes their worst because of better organization.

"Finding 4chan around 07 shaped my ability to objectively think for myself. 
I can only imagine what mindless drone regurgitating whatever information is fed to me by whoever I would have ended up chosing as The Absolute Authority to blindly follow, and it disgusts me. Knowing of 4chan before the media's first attacks against the boards enlightened me to how ridiculous the main source of information the average citizen was fed and not questioned.

 Graduating HS in 12 I could see how worthless and time/money wasting the degrees from college would be for my goals, because of the reasoning and critical thinking skills that were beaten into me from following the contrasting stories and information between 4chan and the mainstream. which saved me from that debt shackle into mindless wage slave so many of my generation fell victim to that's being used to train them to be dependent on the system that oppressed them in the first place. 

I will never forget the absolutely hilarity and triumph that was 2016, though bittersweetly as it was probably 4chans finest hour and seems to me it's peak that will never be topped. It's sad thought that it seems it will continue it's decline since then.

"4chan is also important for being the last bastion of a freer internet. Of the pre-monetized internet, where anyone and everyone could run a website, and where most major discussion boards were not so heavily censored for the sake of 'feelings'. Unfortunately, for valid discussion to happen, both sides have to be willing to have their views challenged. This censorship based on 'feelings' does not allow for challenging of views, it does not allow for strong argument. Just look at the (rather disturbing) trend of comedians having to somewhat sanitize their commentary, less they suddenly cannot find work unless they are already too well-known to be quietly wiped away. 


It also sucks pretty hard to see how obviously one side of the socio-political divide is far more willing to censor the other. Censorship does happen on both sides, but the general trend I've observed is that left-leaning hosts will immediately remove you for saying something 'hurtful', while right-leaning ones will call you an idiot, and often even bother to explain WHY they feel that way. They leave you to express your opinion, and to have why that opinion isn't accepted explained, as opposed to more left-leaning places that won't even bother to engage, you will either get buried under a flood of vitriol lacking any substance, or you will be quietly silenced for your views. Yes, you will get vitriol on the other side, but you will also see more people attempting to actually engage with what you said, as opposed to lambasting you for perceived slights, or declaring you invalid due to poor wording.","[""That's because Leftist views are all entirely based on lies, and lies always fail in a debate against the truth.""]",2022-09-05T16:28:00Z,@jtnachos16

"You can have your opinions about Freedom of Speech (that is your right), but the objective truth is that Freedom of Speech is not regarded as absolute. Most legal systems generally are setting limits on the freedom of speech, particularly when freedom of speech conflicts with other rights and protections, such as in the cases of libel, slander, pornography, obscenity, fighting words, and intellectual property. Actually the whole concept of ""Freedom of Speech"" should be called differently since it seems like the current name is creating confusion. Freedom of Speech is not absolute (and it shouldn't be) since your freedom to oppress other people will only lead to more suffering. If the Freedom of Speech will ever become absolute,  then the world will suddenly become  much more darker and more dangerous place to live. Every fanatic would be allowed to spread their ""wisdom"". That's how all the dictators came to power. They where allowed to speak their hatred on people with different colour. Hatred on people with different religion. Hatred on people with different sexual orientation. Hatred on disabled people. Hatred on women etc... And people listened and took it as their own. And suddenly the Freedom of Speech what used to exist, was no more. Only iron curtain and concentration camps remains. It is very ironic that, if Freedom of Speech is used incorrectly, the biggest threat to Freedom of Speech is the Freedom of Speech it self.","['""meh i don\'t like what you say so I\'m gonna censor you"" \n\nyou realize how much of moron you sound like don\'t you?']",2022-09-04T19:21:02Z,@GeneralMiller92FIN
"It is scary to me how people today claim to be open-minded and tolerant, but only if they agree with the other group's opinion.
Because that is the opposite of open-minded and tolerant. To bring up a very recent event, Pedos do in fact have human rights. It is not okay to punch a nazi. And all the other paradoxical crap they believe.

Do these people not ask themselves how the Nazis felt about Jews? Because that is exactly it. A large evil force that must be stopped. And they felt good fighting the jews. 
Todays Hitler is a black lesbian woman and the world is eager to set up the camps.

When you see photos of the concentration camps, where Nazis were kicking jews on the ground, you are suppose to think ""Doing this to people is wrong"" and not ""It should be the other way around"".
These people would never step up and stop slavery like the north did in the civil war. They don't care about freedom. They want to flip the sides. Jews should kill nazis, woman should beat man, black people should enslave white. It is not that Killing, Beating and Enslaving is wrong, nononono. Quite the opposite, actually.
So it is okay to kill Nazis. Who is a Nazi? Everyone who disagree with them, proof not needed. You don't need to listing to people explain themselves if they are already branded a nazi. It is even okay if they ""could be"" a nazi. That is enough.

And the worst part? They think they are the good guys.","[""that's why I love the n word. It's the biggest litmus test and filter and it takes a tenth of a second to say.

Thet sold out and went Republican light when the Clintons took power over the party. Hillary was a Republicunt her whole life and just decided to switch because her whore husband was a ""Dem"". You expect her to be honest?\n\n Honesty was never a thing for Republican politicians. And we\'ve always known that on the left. But for the ladt 30 or so years the two parties merged into one.

You can\'t see that the media are just corporate shills? CNN just got done condemning the debt relief for college. They shit on Bernie all the time. They pander to the feelings of rich swines complaining about taxes. They are not left at all. Lol. They\'re called the Clinton News Network for a reason. And Clinton is a blue dog Democrat, Republican light. Legacy ""left"" media is centrist to center right. Any truly left media is independent and online. \n\nYou are indicative of how further right the country is edging. Fact: we are the most right wing of the western 1sr world imperial legacy countries.

3_All Religions > Personal/Internal/Cultural Beliefs and Faith in One's Self and Community.

5_Politics/Politicians > Small, Transparent Governance through Law and Order. Designed and held accountable by only the People/Citizens and Country it serves.

"I'm old as fuck. Discovered the site around 2005-ish? It's been a hell of a thing watching the tenor change over time.

But I think something that's glossed over - not only in this video but also in the discussions around it - is that the absolute worst that humanity has to offer will invariably make itself manifest in places where it is allowed to. And occasionally - in the chaos of it all - there will emerge little diamonds of truth - but one has to wonder if there aren't better ways of finding them, than wading through all the raw sewage.

It is without a doubt, a far more vicious and hateful place than it used to be. And it's always been vicious and hateful among many other things; at some point you have to ask yourself if what you're exposing yourself to is actually good for you. Sure - corporate Internet is a plague, and is designed to keep you engaged at all costs, and there is no question that this is a major contributing factor to the threat of a worsening quality of life - but 4chan's lack of consequence cultivates an unrealistic expectation for how reality outside of that environment is - if not presenting outright parallel reality - where the rules of what is and isn't acceptable are suspended, and there are extremely few consequences for behaving in absolutely vile ways - but there will be absolutely no shortage of validation from people who do agree with your approach. You run the very real risk of developing utterly maladaptive coping mechanisms that render you increasingly reliant on a place where even -having a coherent identity- is frowned upon. 


And you're a fucking fool if you don't think that it presents a risk of being addictive and deluding. Outrage dopamine loops occur somewhat more naturally without the guidance of algorithms or corporate money - but they still occur, and the relatively populist source of the loops does not mean that they are inherently more true. Indeed - Facebook, Toktok, Twitter, Reddit - the top-down approach is certainly wrong - but that doesn't automatically mean than 4chan is more right. 

That sensation of being on the fringe, of being virtuous and beleaguered - strong for virtue of surviving the gore/rekt threads without flinching, of speaking your truth to a knowing and accepting - yet nevertheless faceless audience? 

It's a lie. I know from experience. I used to buy into it. 

Think of it like -  the site is kind of our collective-cultural Id. Not everything your id inspires you to do and say is good.","[""To put this more succinctly - \n\r\nI do think it's a good idea to spend time in these places. it can be liberating, and a good place to play devil's advocate with your own ideals. It's good to be exposed to ideas that are wildly opposed to your own. At the very least, you have to know what your opponents are saying in order to mount effective arguments against them.\n\nBuuuut it is extremely unhealthy - psychologically and socially - to never experience consequences for your actions and words. Spending too much time in an environment where you develop this as a baseline expectation will be profoundly alienating. It is easy to see this alienation as a simple, noble consequence of being more in-tune with the rude-truth of the world. But this is *just* a cope. A society that actually mirrored the 4chan environment would be fucking miserable."", ""I've seen lot of people acting like they do online, its the most cringe and sad thing i've ever seen, and im talking collective-cultural id thing"", '@@TheWersum  Indeed. You see the same behavior patterns in people who spend too much time on the internet as you see in presidents and senators across all political spectra. Church leaders. Small business owners in rural communities. Celebrities. Talking heads on the 24/7 fecal news cycle. Wherever there is no accountability. Nobody is immune to the deleterious psychological effects of facing no consequences (or worse: Validation) for acting like a complete anus. \n\nI\'m not saying I have all the answers, obviously.  The questions of ""Who gets to hold who accountable - for what transgressions, by what means, and why?"" is a problem that we\'ve been trying to answer since we were well evolved enough to smear our shit on cave walls.', ""But at least you know there's a place where things are not repressed. And if you have a good center it's not going to affect you in a real way."", ""Re: Good centers and personal resilience\nI would like to think that a reasonable, mature adult has some degree of control over what extent any experience may or may not impact them. I'm not so confident that this is the case, however. Otherwise there wouldn't be much of a thing as 'culture'.  I tend to look at it like a goal that can never be completely attained, but should nevertheless be pursued insistently. \n\nWe -myself included- suffer from a great deal of the dunning-kruger effect when it comes to assessments of our own psychological resilience. We really don't have any reliably way to directly observe how our day-to-day experiences may or may not be affecting us until well after the fact. Even being aware of this doesn't mean that I'm immune to its effects. Repeated exposure to a sensation numbs you to it. Spend enough time shoveling shit and you stop smelling it. There's some value in that inurement. But it's probably good to know at least, when we start to stink. Not a perfect metaphor, mind you, but i'm already getting way more verbose than I originally intended to. \n\nI like to think that I have a good handle on my shit, but it's precisely that line of thinking that allows one to get complacent about how tight that grip actually is. \n\nAnd this is *why* i still lurk and sometimes argue in places where the population and I will tend to disagree, but find spending too much time in that mode numbs me to things that are probably better left tender. \n\nVariety of experience is important, and that's not something you can get from spending all your time in a single place.""]",2022-08-08T08:36:14Z,@btango7029

"Where do I start with this?

Let's start with the Holocaust: I come from Germany, and thus know way more about the holocaust simply through going to school than almost any other average student in any other country.
Denying the Holocaust is one of the worst things you can do. Erasing the endless suffering, shouting at victims for being victims, all those indecencies are not free speech. They are harassment. They are insults. They are traumatizing. They are flat out wrong. 
I can fully agree with the stance of the German government having Laws against dening the Holocaust. It is plain and simple the only ""Free Spech"" Crime you can do without adressing someone.

To keep on going: Free Speech in the Internet is consequence free. There will be no consequence. When you venture too far at the ""regulars table"" you will get some backlash and you will have to listen to it. If you don't you will get reprimanded by the group and that is a rough thing in a small community. On the internet there simply are no consequences. If you get something you don't like, you will get annoyed and you are only one click away from it being gone.  You will get no consequences. And that is not how free spech works.
It only works, when you get genuine reactions to what you say. If you're in echo chamber free spech will revolve around ""what you can't say"" according to your view of the other side.  There is a great video from cgpgrey about that toppic. ""This Video will make you angry"".
Unlimited free spech is great in a conventional sense, when you get direct reactions.
I don't like Nazis demonstrating near me. But they are free to do so. They just have to live with a very large gathering oposing them. 

Take a step further to the user. To roughly quote your video: You will find absolutely and only find the fringe of society here. 
There is a reason why we didn't have widespread issues with conspiracy theories before. There is a reason why there are leaders now which can't form one coherrent sentence. There is a reason why clever cults have found a way into online presence. Or are even formed through it.
These people search for a simple answer for their suffering, which doesn't involve chance. Thus it is easy to follow a leader who says: ""The Elites"". Often enough. You will hear chance in those explanations as well. But you will hear a chosen to be unlucky at nearly the same time. 
In a world however which grows ever more complex. Where a conflict 10000 miles away can end your life, you want simple answers. 

And don't get me started on the ""people are the problem"" Argument.
That only works in a isolated world, where no one has a influence on the other. However, we are bound by social interactions, we crave for recognition, we want to express ourself. That is a reason, why those echochambers build themself.
If you take the echochamber out, people will behave differently. You might then say: ""But it's the peoples fault who run the echochamber"". Or you might say: ""It's free speech"". You might even shout: ""For Freedom"".
If you want total freedom you have to live in space, with noone around. There your actions are meaningless on other people. Those are who limit your freedom. Those are who enable you to do things. Those are who will listen to you. Those are who will pick you up after a accident. Those are the reason why you are alive in the first place. Those are the ones who formed who you are now. Those are the reason, why you react to certain stimuli in a certain way. Those are the reason, why your right to absolute free spech is limited.

You are free to think whatever you want. But you're not free to say everything to anyone. Turn that around and you will soon notice why. You will notice why we have put boundraries in place to stop that. If you dig deeper you will find flaws in the System. Everytime. Always.

I belive, that it is our job as humans to improve our System to a point where the System is good enough to be able to run permanently (disregarding non human external uncontrollable influences)[This took like 5 tries. And I'm certain you will find a way to make a human do a bad thing to disturb the system, which fits those critera]

The internet as great as it is has flaws in it as well. And that is A) it is a System B) it has to do with people.","['‚ÄúYou are free to think whatever you want.

No one outside of 4chan really used the term Incel until 2016/2017 or so lmfao


That said, every single 4chan user I know irl that isnt in a relationship or married is either a volcel or indifferent to being in a relationship, none of the people I've met are self loathing nor do they think women dislike them for being ugly its the other way around, they dislike [most] women for their behaviour and the lack of things they have to offer in a relationship.

freedom as a whole is going extinct in this time period, stuff like the hong kong protests, even the supreme courts decision on women, even gender equality or race equality hasnt been fully established yet here you are acting like people have all the freedom they need

"So, like, platitudes about free speech are great and all, but, if you drill down even a little bit, it‚Äôs not like free speech was ever really being suppressed, at least in the West.

Sure, the mainstream media actively balked at more extremist ideologies, but no one was forcibly silencing the weebs and outcasts. No one with any serious authority was trying to shut down 4chan.

What we‚Äôre left with is a bunch of butthurt (generally) white boys in their teens and early 20s whining about how their free speech is being impinged because the mainstream media won‚Äôt give screen time to their edgelord  pizzagate bullshit.

And then this same demographic throws it‚Äôs legitimate collective power and influence behind political figures who leverage that dumbshit edgelord culture into policies that are either directly or indirectly trying to strip rights away from demographics of people who are experiencing genuine marginalization.

The free speech argument falls apart immediately when you realize that no one in the mainstream media or political establishment is actually trying to take away free speech, and the only reason anyone on 4chan believes they are is because of their incestuous interactions with the aforementioned unfounded conspiracy theories that they came up with in the first place.

Should 4chan be allowed to continue existing? Of course, we all fucking believe in free speech‚Ä¶ anyone who isn‚Äôt a piece of shit (and even the vast majority of actual pieces of shit in the western world) do.

The internet is a place for people to slowly lose their ability to think critically by removing all consequences from failing to do so until people have the argumentative abilities of literal 5-year-olds. You lose a bit of your own critical thinking when you converse with such people, either by having it degraded through exposure, or by just assuming that everyone you disagree with is that unreasonable.

"Holy ish this is exactly as bs as I feared it would be. ONLY by - .... saying whatever bs pops into your head, can you hear a rebuttal...? Duuuuuhhhh NO, gaudy bs tacitly nonsense overstatement. If I go to school and listen to a teacher tell me why glasses don't = bully target, than NO as a matter of fact it is NOT the case that the ONLY way for me to stop bullying that kid is to bully them for a minute. Not to mention all kinds of hate speech goes unanswered if spoken away from people who will speak against it, such that said hate speech can infect minds. I can call a kid four eyes without hearing somebody tell me why it's wrong, bro; and I don't need somebody to tell me not to say four eyes if somebody just explains to me how and why to be kind before I get the chance

Bro that is SUCH a nonsense thing to say, that literally ONLY by airing ill-conceived bile can ill-conceived bile be countered. I don't need to hear every single new way some dumb 14 year old thinks black people are bad to be able to make the scientifically informed statement that no epidermal melanin ratios have behavioral consequences outside of a context in which they are subjugated, or the objective logical statement that you can't just weigh one culture v another and come out with a single metric for ""better v worse"", nor the objective moral statement that differences aren't bad (or further the scientific statement that diversity is by a large margin generally beneficial especially in the long run)

That's so fuqqing stupid and childish bro. You're not actually thinking about the things you're saying, you're just barking out phrases and trigger words and auto-complete clich√© mish-mash. Honestly even with this being my first video of yours and only being halfway through, I still don't believe you're dumb enough to actually believe that, assuming you actually bother to think about it. Not because I have any particular impression about your intelligence, but purely because it's just that fuccing dumb. The only kind of person who could really actually think about that and continue to maintain that position is either mind-numbingly simple (like, too simple to run a youtube channel by far) or just outright lazily malicious and hoping nobody will question them on it



Jesus fuqqing christ bro. Read a book or something. Look at a cloud for a while and just think. Actually think. Don't just let topical clich√©s float past your consciousness in a meandering fashion, actually THINK about context and consequences and whatnot, holy fuqq, kid, jesus. Who let you out of school......? That's so gawd dayumed moronic. That's literally baby thought. Little children think like that. Are you like 9...? Serious question. Your voice sounds post-pubescent, but some people hit that early so I dunno, you're breaking my brain over here

""Only by allowing every single racist thought to be expressed can we respond to racism!"" .......... sounds like something somebody who wants to hear more racism would say, I gotta be honest brah. No. You don't actually need to spout bile to learn to be decent. Like.... You're figuratively pissing on so much basic psychology right now it's almost unfathomable. ""You know only by calling your wife the c word can you honestly express your frustration over her not doing the dishes, and only through your honest expression can your relationship begin to heal as you see each other for who you are and get to choose to accept each other or not"".         .....k, good luck with your marriage brah. Me, I'mma stick to not calling my wife the c word when she doesn't do the dishes - if I have an urge to call my wife the c word when she doesn't do dishes, maybe I'd consider, like, thinking about myself and what mental framework and causal structure led to me having such a strong reaction to such a small stimuli. Maybe I'd go to therapy. Maybe I'd talk to my wife. Maybe I'd do, ooh I dunno, almost anything else. Maybe if I wanted to be honest with my wife, I would be honest about my feelings without actually shouting that word at her in a heated moment with no effort given to controlling such a hurtful impulse, so we could address the root problem without doing it, ya know, after one of the two of us just had the c word shouted at us for not doing some dishes or w/e tf (something which might make it harder for one or both of us to continue in the healthiest and most ready headspace, wouldn't you say......)


Freedom of speech is NOT important _because people need to be able to say bad things so we can say good things_     you fuccing dunce
Freedom of speech is important for several reasons including misunderstandings, sarcasm, philosophical musings, and perhaps most relevant in the minds of the writers (though I'm no history buff), important in it's ability to allow the writers to be lazy and still achieve their goal of stopping malicious governances from stamping out decent criticism, without them (the writers) having to actually spend an extra five years trying to perfectly distill exactly how to maintain in perpetuity the ability of a populace to criticize justly
You don't need people to say bad things to say good things dude XDD try it right now. Say a good thing. ....see how easy that was..? Your freedom to say good things wasn't inherently causally a consequence of somebody else saying a bad thing

"7:42 effort? Yeah, maybe for a few days or a few weeks but it never goes past that. The thing about 4chan is that their anonymity creates an impression of unity. One user looks and often acts the same as the next so entirely different groups of people can be behind different campaigns and it just gets labeled as ""4chan."" I think it's the same thing that leads to massive riots and rapid political destabilization. Violence leads to anonymity as the police can only arrest so many people, people who would otherwise be deterred from violence now gain the confidence to cause more chaos which creates more violence, more anonymity, and more confidence in those who would normally stay out of it. Once the violence ends, most everyone goes home and may spend the rest of their life as a normal, seemingly eel adjusted person. It's the same on 4chan. Think of the time they trolled the Dub the Dew competition. Users get on 4chan out of boredom, see a thread with a funny idea, and go to the website to cast their votes for whatever deplorable name they so desire. Some people with skills in programming and access to server farms took it one step further and used bots to vote en masse. But after a couple weeks, done. Many of those people likely never participated in another 4chan event again. It's important to keep in mind that when you go on 4chan and talk to someone they could get offline mid discussion and some other user can seamlessly take their place without anyone noticing. Over a course of weeks and months, a lot of people have been replaced with new users. 

TL:DR the impression of individual users having the drive to go on multiple lengthy trolling campaigns is largely due to the fact that individual users can log onto 4chan, participate for a short period of time, disappear, and be seamlessly replaced creating an impression of a group of organized, dedicated trolls.",[],2022-06-08T21:20:15Z,@NoNo-xh7ru

if you make an inaccurate assumption about someone (pepe the frog is a hate symbol) then people will run with it as a joke. 

not only does 4chan run ads (and take money) but there are numerous examples of moot and hiroyuki suppressing threads and topics. not only that, the mods can delete any post they'd like to. it's not a ""last bastion of free speech"" like any other chan is.

But these ramifications should never stretch into somebody's livelihood or welfare. Nobody should feel afraid of what expressing an opinion could do to their careers, or even their life. Society has been launched into an era where the opinions of others are readily accessible, and this has caused many new realms of thought to open up- but we haven't yet learned how to tolerate 'bad' opinions. We need to learn to, however. Our moral code is not the same as it was 100 years ago, and it will surely change again in the future- but we should be able to form our morals around every opinion. A hundred years ago, being gay was sinful, wrong, against evolution and what mankind stood for- those people truly thought that they were right to persecute the gay community. Maybe in the future, we'll discover something wrong that we do now that is so natural to us at this moment that we can't fathom it ever being wrong."", ""There's a massive difference between being scorned by your peers for being a cunt and being deplatformed and unpersoned by corporations for not being a mindless consumer.""]",2022-05-11T12:21:00Z,@sitodev

"I have lurked about 4chan since around late 2004, not quite the beginning but close enough.  The biggest changes for me has been the slow lessening of weeb culture across the site and with it the need to fill the space left from that focus with political and social agenda.  It isn't that there wasn't Nazi jokes, for instance, but they weren't the core of the site.  Part of my critique of 4chan has always been that it gave people anonymity and freedom but they did not use it to tell the truth or voice their ideas, they used it to create a false persona and to simply pretend to be more autsitic and retarded then they really were.  They are the ostracized of society but the amount of people ACTUALLY on the bottom is less and less, it is just more entertaining to make up an elaborate story of a negative view of society.  I do agree with you though that these people often don't feel like they have a voice, of which pretending to be a neo nazi on a korean underwater basket weaving forum will get you some level attention or at least if you follow the latest memes and trends a community to belong to.

"lol 4chan fanfic from a cringelord that thinks they are a free thinker bc they hold ""unpopular ideas""

 ""4chan was the birth of internet culture""
Sure maybe for people of a certain age, but internet culture has always been about geeks and social outcasts contracting through the anonymity of the internet. This was true before 4chan's days of mass impact and it is true now that 4chan is far less relevant these days.

The idea that ""4chan did not care about money"" blatantly ignores the fact that moot sold it for what was likely a hefty sum for him at the time. As well it ignores that it is not so much that the creator or current owner does not care about making and more to do with the market does not see much value in that platform. So you really can't conclude that if 4chan ever could make money it would still decline to do so. But hey let's spin that as ""its not about money"" lol

Lots of narrative driven talking points in this vid that ignore the nuances of reality, like for example the ADL never said Pepe was a symbol of hate and clearly stated that it was a meme and some of those memes were in the context of hate ideology symbolism. So yeah context matters, saying ""it's just a meme bro"" does not mean the context just magically goes away if you go around spamming nazi pepes bc ""he he I'm so quirky and edgy am not like other trolls.""

A bit of push back about the primary premise of this fanfic
We need 4chan bc of ""muh free speech""

But 4chan is not free speech...it has and probably will again forbid content at the whims of those with power over 4chan.
A perfect example of this was when boxxy became a forbidden meme on 4chan and people were banned for posting boxxy.
4chan is not a utopian incorruptible decentralized platform where no one wields the power to censor or control what is allowed on that platform. 

Also want to point out the misconception that freedom of speech somehow means all views and ideas are on some kind of equal footing.

That is simply not true in an actually free market place of ideas.
Bad ideas and views fail, there is no obligation for an actually free market place of ideas to ensure that those failed views, values, and ideologies must be preserved and protected from failure.

There is also this misconception that the only way to defeat bad ideas is with logic and reason.
However, most people that continue to subscribe to ideologies, values, and views that have already failed in the free market place of ideas are not motivated by logic and reason, if that were the case then they would abandon them after they failed. 

So the notion that a free market place of ideas must provide a platform for failed ideologies to form an echo chamber to insulate themselves from being ""forced to think the same as normies"" is laughably absurd and the antithesis to the entire reason why free speech is actually important, so that good ideas succeed...which consequently means bad ideas fail.
If people still want to waste their energy with those failed ideologies that is their prerogative, but that alone now entitles them to have those failed ideologies treated as competitive or valuable in an actually free market of ideas. Nope...not how that works.

The idea that ""4chan is so important bc on other platforms people are forced to conform bc the ideologies I subscribe to have failed and I refuse to express my independence with a novel thought or any thought that differs from those I already hold"".... 

...well that must be some kind of meta ironic troll. As if there is no diversity of thought or original thought coming from areas of the internet other than 4chan?!?

Free speech was never about treating all ideas as equally valid or ensuring that failed ideologies are not threatened by successful ideologies. The free market place of ideas was never about coddling people that refuse to abandon failed ideologies and insulating from the consequences of that refusal.

The idea that there is some ""mainstream narrative"" is also absurd...there is no mass consensus on ""the narrative""

This is the delusions of people with a victim complex must maintain to justify becoming even more radicalized in their own failed ideologies. They are the victims not bc they refuse to move on from those beliefs, but bc the ""normies"" have not treated their failed ideologies as being just and equal, valid, and relevant in the free market of ideas.

""If the free market of ideas does not value my failed ideologies then this is akin to oppression against me, and I must take ever increasingly more desperate measures to defend myself against that aggression""
This is the rationalization of radicalization. 

When really they are not oppressed, of course, you could always actually conceive of an original thought or adopt existing ideas that have not failed in the free market of ideas, rather than clinging to already tested and failed ideologies...but of course, why would any reasonable person consider that option?

So no.

Sorry to burst your fanfic bubble but 4chan has nothing to with ""enlightenment values"" and no amount of moral grandstanding will change the fact that if you want to know what 4chan is about...you can just go there...and see for yourself that it has nothing to do with enlightenment values.",[],2022-03-30T10:12:36Z,@memegazer

"I am quite tired of people having no idea what free speech is. 

Free speech is NOT being able to say whatever you want online. 
It is NOT being able to say or do whatever you want on Twitter. 

All free speech protects is your right for the GOVERNMENT to not go after you for what you say as long as it isn't libel or death threats. 

You do NOT have a right to a Twitter account. 
You do NOT have a right to a computer or internet access. 
You do NOT have a right to say whatever you want free from social consequences or private industry rules. 

You all agree to the terms of service when you sign up for a social media account. Don't like getting banned for saying the n-word? Oh, well. Go say it in some dark corner of the internet where nobody can hear you. It isn't censorship. And it has nothing to do with ""free speech."" You aren't owed a megaphone. You aren't owed a platform. All you can do is say what you want free from the government arresting you.

You don't have a right to go into the nearest McDonalds and start shouting the n-word at everyone unimpeded because ""muh free speech."" Just like you don't have a right to say whatever you want on Twitter.


""Bastion for free speech."" Give me a break. Trump wanted to change libel laws in a way that would've destroyed free speech across the country and wanted to get rid of Section 230, which would've effectively destroyed the internet as it would've made websites legally responsible for every post on their sites. The Republican party is the one currently passing laws to ban books and speech in classrooms (literal actual censorship.)

We've all played the ""free marketplace of ideas game."" It didn't work. As it so happens, if you ban a bunch of fascists and take away their platforms and megaphones, they actually do less damage to society. 4chan should've been banned and deleted years ago along with every other toxic cesspool of garbage on the internet that peddles itself as a ""free speech bastion"" when they have no idea what free speech is in the first place.",[],2022-03-27T05:35:40Z,@dzed5579

"Oh fuck you. Both sides is bullshit. Shutting down 'free speech' is one of the only actions that the public has to express itself. Suppression is expression. When your friend tells you to 'shut the fuck up about racist shit,' they're not stopping free speech, they're expressing their own. Corporations and governments are different, they're not people. 

'Cancel culture' is just the newest name for the ongoing argument about what reality actually is. The difference is that now social relationships are so abstract that people can easily say that the social sanctions they're receiving aren't from their 'real' social group. 

If you believe in free expression then fucking get involved in politics. Remove monetary fines for violations (disproportionate punishment for the poor, should be replaced with community service), remove lobbying (legal bribes), refine the american political system (ranked choice voting and removing the elector system), Abolishing private prisons, etc. etc. Fight in any way for actual change. Do. Fucking. Something. It doesn't matter if it's local or brief, actually talk to humans.

Because in actual human conversation people don't scream memes at each other and walk away, they're forced to deal with the repercussions of what they express. As the internet becomes less anonymous it is increasingly mirroring that reality.

Also revolutionaries aren't on 4 chan. It's a public forum that's easily government monitored. If they are then they're fucked.

"Interesting perspective. But you're missing something: For almost all of human history, freedom of speech has been moderated. We lived in small communities, and if you had extreme opinions you were very unlikely to encounter anyone else who shared that opinion. Ideas could only gain traction within the community if they had enough merit to win an argument and survive being challenged. Otherwise, you would either have your opinion changed by the better argument, or learn to keep it to yourself. You couldn't even be sure of passing your opinion on to your own children, because they were raised by the whole village. 

But places like 4chan, because of their anonymity and the way they are structured, provide a meeting point where extreme opinions can go unchallenged, are there are radicalisation pathways to push people towards more extreme views. These places provide social credit for holding opinions that have no merit or are downright dangerous - ideas that would make you a social pariah if you expressed them in your local community - reinforcing and metastasizing them until they spill out into the real world with real world consequences. 

It's not that communities never formed around extreme ideologies before the internet, they did, but they tended to be much more limited in their size and scope. 4chan and its ilk, by massively increasing the size, power, and reach of such communities, represent a degree of freedom of speech that humanity has arguably *never* had before.

I don't know what the solution is. I mean, yes, we should teach people how to think better, but the human brain handed to us by evolution is a hot mess of biases, emotions, and hallucinations, and we can't expect everyone to be able to overcome that. Extreme ideas will always be around, and maybe it's best for society if we choose not to give them a platform and a safe space that encourages them to fester and grow unchallenged.","[""Fuck right the hell off with your choosing safety over freedom.

"Vehemently disagree. Free speech is important, sure. 4Chan has facilitated spontaneous organisation, demonstrations and protest, absolutely. But 4Chan has become too infested to be even enlightenment values adjacent.

FREE SPEECH IS NOT A GUARANTOR OF YOUR RIGHT TO HATE SPEECH.

Supporting free speech does not mean supporting a festering s**thole (is this case 4Chan) of n*zi's, f**cists and genocidal maniacs.

On top of that, 4Chan's infrastructure is borked PRECISELY BECAUSE of it's complete and utter lack on moderation. Thanks to the proliferation of bots and propagandists, free speech and discussion in an open forum is now impossible due to the white noise flooding the platform.

Lastly, I say this as an incredibly nerdy, geeky and autistic outcast... YOU HAVE FREE SPEECH ALREADY STUPID MOTHERF**KER. Go outside and speak to someone. And if you get your jaw broken for talking shit? You deserve it. Nut the f**k up p**sy.",[],2022-01-16T14:42:49Z,@anarchicnerd666

"Man, really, that's humiliating in a sense. You are describing an idealized 4chan where everybody has a similar mindset and votes for Trump. The 4chan community is enormous and fully anonymous. There are all types of people there. You are talking about hackers and haters and indeed 4chan has plenty of that too, but there are also people talking about feelings, guilt, and even some serious discussions, people that just like to understand others' perspectives, or that are there just for the fun of reading crazy and different ideas.

Yeah, indeed people can let their shadow run loose on the /b/ board and that is great, it means we have a window to understanding people and for people to be understood that we would not have otherwise. It doesn't mean at all that the community is acting like a single-minded organized entity. Making any claim about the type of people that goes to 4chan is weird in the sense that you don't know them, you probably have friends that participate and you don't know that because they are not outright extremists or outcasts or anything that you might expect from the stereotype you are describing

People like to talk without restraints, share things that they like, experiment seeing the reaction of others to ideas they have of themselves, talk about insecurities, think about things from the perspective of people they might never meet in real life. And 4chan has all that too.

Yeah, I think you can say that most 4chan users are in favor of free speech, and several 4chan users use it to talk about hidden and hateful feelings, and finally that some of these users are hackers that want to join a cause (sometimes a stupid cause), but saying that they're all hateful hackers in an organized movement is taking a stereotype of people you don't know and extrapolating it to everybody. You can't really talk about 4chan while also ignoring its plurality, it's a communication channel with lots of different people.","['Ok, I was too hard on the video, I had only watched the first half of the video xP.']",2022-01-16T12:29:22Z,@viniciusgarcia3452

We live in a world were far too things have been taken for trust, and people get away with far too much ...""

That juxtaposition is wrong. Very wrong. And possibly at the root of a greater problem: you can communicative with images more than words, and by choosing those images, you have presented something very false.

This is the problem to me. You speak of free speech, but to me concepts, ideas and truths are build by associations from many sources. 3 points make a triangle. As such, three wrong images, in three different fields, form a concept without you even needing to make it into words. As such, this is the innate danger of sites of 4chan: the freedom without responsibility will lead to the reproposal of the basic instinct and images of our minds, which will get on the forefront always more than the meaning of our words. This grows in power through the symbolic and interpretative nature of images, as the memes, way more than through words","['All I hear is, ""I\'m a fascist and want to impose my will on others.

They generally say that ""This is how it works"". Full stop.\n\nMy problem is that one thing is to have values. Another thing is to refuse to put those values to the test. \n- Having a free space to express oneself is great. \n- Spreading one\'s view by criticizing other is quite fair. \n- Using elements from rhetoric to create further meaning without pointing that out, thus having others\'s believes to fill in the blanks, and therefore ""making themselves"" part of your idea, thus creating commitment, is a salesman technique that should not be implemented. \n\nThis technique is unfortunately integral part of our network society, were memes and images are longer lasting presence in our minds that actual words. \n\nNow, before we make a sacrifice to the gods of youtube by waging a skirmish on this platform, i\'ll say it again: i don\'t wish to have juxtaposition of fraudulent content in a video that talks about freedom of speech. \n\nI interpreted those sequences as a no vax message.

To a Christian, a challenge is to mediate the idea of god and the possibilities of multiverses, heat death of the universe and other absolute ideas.

"Moon gets slightly trapped here -- obscenely toxic contrarianism ultimately destroys freedom of speech. For more detail, check the Paradox of Intolerance.

"Id like to take a moment and explain to people who are confused about the political shift in 4chan's userbase between the ""Anonymous Hack"" era and the ""Trump"" era. 
The political side of the site used to be filled to the brim with libertarians. i.e. believing in freedom no matter the cost. During the time of the Anonymous hacks/Occupy wallstreet, there was a schism in the ""group"" if you could call it that. Some believing that they should take their newfound publicity and popularity and go after major institutions, enact change, ect. While others only being in it for the laughs, and weren't interested in continuing. This is just one example but it goes to show that the entire userbase rarely ever agrees on something. 

I say this because during all of this conflict, the libertarians were ""winning"" the site over. If you are locked in a forum where you are allowed to say whatever you want, certain political ideologies thrive and others die. As I'm sure some of you know, it is damn near impossible to out argue an autist, especially when they know their shit. Because of this, users decided to either stay and face constant insults and ridicule for their political beliefs, or leave. And thus, there was a mass exodus from 4chan by communists, anarchists, and generally left leaning people to 8chan. Some stayed, most lefties who did stay basically became diet libertarians, adopting a more ""personal freedom no matter the cost"" mindset I mentioned above. As time wore on, the left, or as 4chan liked to refer to them as, SJWs became to grow in power and sway as time wore on. This came to a head with GamerGate, where lots of cultural figureheads representing both sides came forward. Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian and others representing the ""SJWs"" and people like Sargon of Akkad, Thunderf00t, and Styxxenhammer666 representing the ""right"". Even though I believe Sargon and Styx both declared themselves lefties, this was the first time mislabeling and tribal mentality came into play on a grand scale. GamerGate attracted lots of like minded people on both sides of the argument, and a culture war was created. 4chan started one of its many trolling campaigns against the SJWs on what was believed to be ""their site"", which was Tumblr. Shock images of gore, animal torture, and radical nazi symbolism was used to ""get a rise"" out of the users who inhabited Tumblr.

This caused the ""SJWs"" to use the blanket term ""Nazis"" to refer to not only GamerGate people, but all of 4chan as well. I mean how could they not, right? To them, these people were disgusting, misogynistic, racist, and hateful. To them it made sense to refer to them as Nazis.  Time passes, and the misuse of the label spread to rational right-leaning people as well, who were caught in the cross-fire. SJWs believing to be fighting against the patriarchy, and thus, the establishment. GamerGate believing to be fighting against the rapid change in culture, fighting against liberal media, and thus, the establishment. It's important to realize, at this point, both sides believing that they are not only in the right (thats obvious) but that they are the ""underdog"" and are fighting against authority. 

Whether you believe one side or the other was actually in the right doesn't matter. This sets the stage for the ""Trump/2016"" era. See, you call a massive group of people nazis enough times, chances are they start to, at the very least, sympathize with other ""nazis"". More time passes and the 4chans ""nazi trolling"" starts to turn inward, users convincing other uses that ""its what they think we are, right?"" and slowly start adopting actual fascist ideology and doctrine. The libertarians from before become more and more radical, adopting more and more nationalistic, racial, and spiritual beliefs. Slowly 4chan starts to politically radicalize it's own users, while on the other side of the fence, the ""SJWs"" have begun their own radicalization campaign. Forming groups like AntiFa to combat, what they saw as a growing rise in fascist beliefs. See how it all comes to a head? 

4chan believing that the corporate media machine is backing the radical left, and in many ways, AntiFa. While the left believing that the authoritarian police state is backing the radical right, and in many ways, 4chan. They both see each other as the oppressor, and see themselves as the underdogs. A lesson is hidden in this story somewhere but I think it ultimately comes down to two things, miscommunication and the digital age. Honestly if you take a step back and look at it all this was the way it was gonna end either way.

I'm by no means an oldf*g on 4chan, I've been on the site since 2012-2013, but I've been there long enough to see it change politically and culturally over time. Theres a sort of hidden non-spoken rule that you aren't supposed to talk about this stuff outside of the site, but I think it's important for not only younger new comers to understand this conflict, but people on the other side of the fence as well. I probably missed some important beats but I didn't want to write to much, so anyone who can add anything important I missed that helps people out of the loop understand this culture war better, I'd appreciate it.",[],2022-01-08T22:19:19Z,@gutrum_vagner

Its existence is inevitable, but I do not think we should praise while forgetting the harm it has caused to many innocent individuals.

"Never thought 4chan would be this deep. I thought it was just like instagram, just filled with memes. I didn't think any social media would have this much thought. What I don't understand mostly is why is there just a giant group of people that are going against control? I thought there were many but from what it sounds like it's not working or they just doesn't exist. I gotta say I already knew what the majority of society think is true isn't because it's not the majority of people. It's the outer shell of a bigger more controlling factor that brainwashes people. Hell you see it in families, some try to nonstop control what their child is going to become and then society makes them even more controlled by other people's thoughts. A lot of people around me in school like to be superficial with each other because they are conditioned to be that way. I'm one of the odd balls that just doesn't want to fit in with the category which makes it hard to make a connection with anyone. Basically what I'm saying is, everything is changing before our eyes for the worse. I rather not be 50 years old and be forced to do certain things and if I talk back once I'm shot or electrocuted. I think what Moon is saying in this video is proving my point further that we need to realize how far things are going and start making our own paths. Think of the people that are trying to control as the farmer leading the sheep. The farmer makes a path for sheep to fall off a ledge which no sheep can see since he has them on blindfolds. The black sheep or just oddball sheep decide to take the blindfold off and realize what's going on. They try to warn everyone but they can't see in front of them until they take off the blindfold. It's exactly the same situation just in a different scenario. Instead of sheep and farmer it's elites and regular people.",[],2022-01-06T02:02:00Z,@topeo3691

Also outside of China, the section on free speech is largely over exaggeration, it's not so much that people can't say stuff, it's more that people in general society will not respond positively to it. America, were I'm guessing he's from is nothing like China, neither Trump or Biden was ever planning on introducing anything like what was happening out in Hong Kong, there is currently no politician or political party that is pushing for these kinds of restrictions on free speech, what's happened is that social norms have changed over time, that's it.","['This comment has to be a joke. \n\nDid you miss out the MASSIVE amounts of information blackouts for the past years?

the problem i have with this argument is that while everyone is and should be allowed to speak freely they are also allowed to be criticized. the argument moon makes in this video is so fundamentally flawed its comical. we can say whatever we want but that doesnt mean we are exempt from criticism or consequences. being ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù is a necessary part of freedom of speech because its those who dont agree with you expressing their own beliefs and also partaking in freedom of speech. obviously investors will pull out of 4chan because pf the negative things that have come out of it but thats because all companies care about is seeming politically correct. they dont care about the issues at hand they just dont want to lose money. thats all corporations care about at the end of the day and is why hyper capitalism is so evil and bad for society. 100% freedom of speech means we should be able to say whatever whenever we‚Äôd like but i think its extremely hypocritical  to say we should not have consequences for what we say when those people criticizing us are just expressing their freedom of speech as well. this is like the third video of moons where he starts out extremely strong and speaking facts until he starts to put his own weird ideologies into it. i dont care if hes right wing and i dont think anyone should be silenced for political affiliation i just think a lot of moons arguments are absolute dog shiit brain dead takes.,"['Shut up kid', 'Agreed tbh', '@UCpqqXM086ojVC__bHDRXADw ur poor stop defending a system that cucks u']",2022-01-05T16:08:27Z,@marcy5269

Like, freedom of speech is important, until some idiots take it as a right to say whatever they want in the ""public debate"" (idk if thats proper english, maybe its public discourse or smth).

This is exactly where the problems start. If you state ""All personal is political"" all the neo-libs start to cringe and republicans start to screech, but something we can totally observe is: ""All personal is a commodity"".
So companies like facebook started to make our ""personal communication"" (atleast within a rather defined circle) public theatre and sold it in exchange for the users data.

Now we have a cultural clash, where people see their online time as just their own little bubble and want to do as they will, whereas companies want to look at and treat it like it's the public, so they can retain their right to monetize the shit out of everything.

In conclusion, i think we gotta get rid of companies that are allowed to make money off of communications technology (turning it into a public service), then re-set the ""spheres of communication"", and after that comes the real problem: Teaching the next generation how to communicate and what the philosophical foundations of freedom are ;)",[],2022-01-04T09:29:18Z,@MannIchFindKeinName

"you lost me at ""it's the only site that didn't care about the advertising money & that's why it was so hated by the establishment"" and then started waxing poetic about how it's so necessary that free-speech be untrampled so that ""dogma can be challenged"". 

Yea that's not why they hated 4chan. show me someone criticizing the site for being ad-free, and i'll stand corrected. but AFAICS they hated it because its community started attacking other communities and radicalizing users.

Also a counterpoint to your free speech argument : neonazi and white supremacist newspapers and conferences have existed without being shut down by the state for ages; their web sites have been up since the beginning of the web. does 4chan really challenge any dogma? or is it a bunch of edgelords that were so ironic about nazi shit that they became sincere (or at least attracted enough nazis to lose that irony)? And your argument falls apart when you consider 'child porn'. even 4chan shut that shit down didn't they? so freedom of speech isn't absolute, as we can all agree (except pedophiles apparently).. and these communities spawned gamergate, fueled incel and similar ideologies, and gave brith to Qanon. now we've got Tucker Carlson radicalizing 3M+ people with his deranged lies and a fascist movement working to dismantle democracy. Is there really no middle ground to be had between the tyrrany of censorship and evil hucksters fomenting insurrections and stochastic terrorism?

So here's my question:was your bastion of free speech worth it? What did you gain?

"The freedom of speech that comes from 'thinking differently' doesn't necessarily mean it's a right/desirable thing. People get all types of thoughts everyday and these thoughts get moulded through our experiences and surroundings. For example a person behind a 4chan account will say how a big government or a simple doctor shouldn't be doing their work like they are supposed to do, because of his personal experience towards it. But if the same person is put in the scenarios of the doctor or the government, given he has no time left to spend on such a website, the views of that person will change drastically and he/she will realise how premature his thought constructs were. 4chan is an absolute prime example of Dunning Kruger Effect.

"This video's thesis is absurd.

TL;DR: the only people that would ever want to use ""free speech"" platforms like 4chan are fascists or edgy kids who are later groomed into becoming fascists.

4chan isn't some kind of neutral platform that establishes a marketplace of ideas. It's a place that is design to breed a culture of hostility, hate, and in generally bigoted viewpoints. Normal people don't thrive in 4chan. White supremacists (/pol/), misogynists (every board), homophobes/tranphobes (ESPECIALLY on the /lgbt/ board), and in general bigoted people who are in a position of privilege in regular society are the only people that will thrive.

Why would you ever spend time on 4chan if your existence as someone other than a straight, white, cisgendered man is met immediately with censure... just by existing, or showing hints of not belonging to that demographic. You will have people immediately comment on and attack your very existence in an edgy, slur-ridden, trollish reply. Which leads to a feedback loop where the only people who actually enjoy their time on 4chan are toxic assholes espousing the worst views, usually in bad faith. If you're a 4chan user, it's assumed that you're a straight/white/cisgendered male until proven otherwise. Maybe you don't check one of those boxes, but you better hide that fact on this platform.

This is not a place for self-expression and free speech. This is a place where you go to be toxic and/or hang around toxic people. It's also not all ""just jokes"" and ""banter."" There are no ironic nazis, sexists, racists, pieces of shit, etc. on 4chan. There are only closeted and bad faith ones. Sure, they might not be a hundred percent serious, but they might as well be.

"I'd love to take your argument at face value yet there are at least 2 major barriers:
1. Sponsored content makes this crumble into disingenuity by forcing a question of motive.
2. Your argument seeks to reframe 4chan and characterize it as distant from the consequences that the platform brings, which is damaging to your argument that freedom comes with responsibility as it shows a lack of ownership that those consequences arose due to a evidently flawed system for freedom of speech.

Good faith or not, it seems to me that you are trying to sell an Idea of 4chan for which you ascribe, yet is not congruent with the reality of the site's users and its consequences, which could be damaging to younger viewers who engage with this platform and go further down the rabbit hole than either of us have.

I reckon we need a platform with consequence, devoid of censorship, yet maintaining dissociation with real word identities. True anonymity doesn't allow this and therefore cannot promote responsibility, so what we have is not freedom of speech, but limitless choice of expression.

"It's an interesting piece about free speech, but it misses some nuance by not paying enough attention to the negative parts of it. The free speech on 4chan also led to child porn defending, racism, anti semitism and anti LGBT sentiments. Even worse, by giving these views a platform, it can be argued 4chan expanded these views to a massive amount of people who wouldn't have otherwise been exposed to it. 

At the end you say it's not part of the pillars of 4cgan, but I think that's too easy. I think it's exactly the result of the unmoderated free speech of 4chan and therefore definitely part of the core of 4chan. Besides that you say it's an inherent part of free speech. To that I would say, maybe, but it's still a massive downside of free speech. What if one persons free speech tries to inhibit somebody else's freedoms by enticing hate against them? Eg are doxing and real life threats just part of free speech?

I don't think these downsides necessarily means the negative are worse than the positives. But the piece does feel unfair by hardly addressing these issues.","['does your name end in berg?', '@@geom8235 no? Why you think so?']",2021-12-31T13:05:25Z,@sjoerdglaser2794

"I first became aware of 4chan during school. One of my friends showed me the site, and I was not especially impressed to say the least.. It appeared to be a site filled with hate and porn.. not much else. However, some years later, when I started learning sociology at the university, I noticied how much data and science that simply wasn't allowed to talk about. I noticed how hard it was to study some particular cases compared to others, - especially things that are considered ""politically incorrect"". 

As for this, I came back to 4chan to study it further. And this video was more or less my conclusion when I finished my studies. 

Now many years later when I've finished my degrees in both sociology and political science, I know for sure how bad this ""global filter"" is for the future. Both the important freedom of speach and democracy is directly threatened by the matter. 
Why is it ""illegal"" to discuss Islam (critically)? Why is it ""forbidden"" to support Trump? Why is it wrong to support the right in politics? Why is'nt it allowed to believe in only two genders? 

The interesting thing about this is the fact that comparative data and actual statistics are completely put aside if it is considered politically incorrect (in many cases, not all). This will, of course, create hate, racism and potential violence in the general society, as seen in many cases (School shootings, the Ut√∏ya massacre etc.). 
Let us showcase this with an example (I will not provide links here, but the facts can easely be located on the Internet): In Islam, women are not considered equal to men. The male in the marriage, will in fact ""own"" his woman. Women, in many cases, are not even allowed to leave their home without the husband. They aren't allowed to take any job, and cannot dress as they'd like. The sexual legal age is as low as 12 in some countries, and has been as low as 9. Islam does not support freedom of speach, nor democracy or religious freedom. 

Yes, those might be some provoking facts for some people. However, in Salafi-Islam, they are indeed actual facts. This is interesting, especially as women's rights (like equality) is so important to descuss today; yet you almost never see the discussion even mention Islamic beliefs, as it is politically incorrect. 

I don't aim to provoke any people with this comment, but I find the topic extremely important to discuss objectively without feelings interupting the actual data.","['@@theanomaly2587 you can\'t criticize the ""that tribe"" weapons against white man. and ""that tribe"" controls everything']",2021-12-31T09:43:20Z,@GoldenNorway1

"4chan is not a ""bastion of free speech"". Neither is it a healthy manifestation of the utilization of free speech: it is an abuse of it, especially those boards where conspiracy theories and bullshit go amok, where not a single ounce of basic human decency is left. Freedom to destroy but does not think of the aftermath leads to chaos. And chaos serves no one but those that take advantage of it.

4chan chant ""shoot the moon"", and bunch of people know nothing about stock market tumble into it and lost millions or even commit suicide, then hedge funds feast on their corpses and dance on their carcasses.

"We‚Äôve always had to fight for speech and basic decency in the US though. We act like we‚Äôve always had this ideal that has never been touched when really we haven‚Äôt. My dad was born in 54 here in rural (formerly) MS. He and his sisters had black and Catholic (people forget about that because it‚Äôs harder to discern) friends and coworkers that weren‚Äôt allowed into the same stores as them. They were not bleeding hearts by any means though. Still very conservative which is good for the most part. 

One of the values they raised me with was the fact that there‚Äôs NOTHING to stop any group from becoming the same way. They knew that through the way southerners were treated post Civil War, by other Confederates who became basically bandits, and ‚Äúcarpet baggers‚Äù who split up the south for cheap labor, and real estate. That STILL happens and if you mention it you‚Äôre called ‚Äúanti-capitalist‚Äù. 

Problem is and I know I‚Äôm gonna get hate for this is that the US just doesn‚Äôt give a shit about anything other that personal validation and entertainment. We don‚Äôt ‚Äúrespect the rights‚Äù of other people. We treat it as a competition where if we don‚Äôt get our way then ‚Äúthey‚Äù have to be punished in some way. 

The US didn‚Äôt give a shit about the soldiers overseas. We claimed to so we could send them of to be slaughtered for profit for 2 decades while encouraging the growth of the Taliban, but any talk of bringing them home is met with an instant rebuke of your patriotism. Even while your friends and family die and people too old to serve talked about how we need a draft, or some kind of compulsory service to the military industrial complex. 

We treat corporations not like organizations that are only interested in psychotic profits 24/7 but like saviors with are best interest at heart ‚Äúcuz wealth means you‚Äôre a better person‚Äù. We have to not only allow them to dodge taxes but give a combined 10% of every tax dollar to millionaire and billionaire companies to ‚Äúcreate jobs‚Äù.

"Is it just me or does it feel like that, while this video makes a great point about freedom of speech, the structure of the video itself is a bit flawed. I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I don‚Äôt like 4chan and this video feels like it‚Äôs trying to sell the viewer that 4chan is a necessary function of society. However, the structure of the video feels too loose in a way. For example, we‚Äôre given a brief history of 4chan but only as far as the Anonymous movement. However, Anonymous hasn‚Äôt done much of significance for a long time now. The video also covers Trump, a highly controversial figure, and goes as far to say that he‚Äôs an embodiment of the kind of leader that 4chan wants and loved. But why was this included in the video? Trump is seen by many as a liar, a bigot, an just as part of the establishment as any other politician and businessman shown in this video. It creates this weird contradiction where 4chan, who we‚Äôre being told are pillars of free speech, are contradicting their own ideology. Trump is a troll, but is he a pillar of free speech. There‚Äôs also very little discussion of what 4chan is now. There‚Äôs mentions of investors pulling out, but only because of vague platitudes regarding the toxicity of 4chan. Maybe most of these problems are due to the video‚Äôs length and it can‚Äôt realistic delve into the complexity of 4chan. Overall though, I remain impressed but ultimately unconvinced that 4chan should be as respected, especially now, as this video would want me to believe.

"Society was ""changed"" only in this way: now the frustratedly childish had a place to scrawl insults _without_ having to damage somebody else's property. It used to be on the bathroom stalls and bus seats.

As someone who knows all the memes,¬π trust me when I tell you that nothing good came of 00's internet counterculture, and that any preservation of 'free' speech that it might've promoted was nothing more than a consequence of its own deeply held, pathologically misanthropic selfishness. Some clever irony or piece of poetic justice will float to the top occasionally, but for the large part it's a mass of scum trying either to bait a reaction or share perversity with his fellow sociopath. There are things I've seen posted that still will not leave my mind's eye nearly 20 years later. The expression of impulse holds no value; it's just a lack of restraint, so don't bother trying to romanticize it. Early 4chan was _not_ the harmless '00s fun of those old sites like 'eBaum's world.' Neither was it idealistic: such a belief is a post-hoc rationalization, because whatever values it seemed to hold were severely overshadowed by its acts of cruelty.       

So, go ahead, play around in the slums there for a bit, until you get the message. But if you ever start to feel camaraderie or a sense of belonging there, it's time to hang up the phone. There's a reason that we've invented civility.    

 ¬πThis ridiculous claim was itself once a minor trolling stratagem, but now it's so old and dead that it no longer shows up in a meme search.

"I have a bit of an issue with the anonymity of 4chan. As you said in the video free speech comes with responsibility and with anonymity that resposibility is taken away. Back in the days the only way to be anonymous in a discussion was to write a book or an article under an alias and even that was pretty hard to do and you wouldnt haphazardly do that with some random opinions you have unlike on 4chan.

"The video alone is a pretty good piece of visual media, definitely engaging to view, but the actual writing feels super biased and hyperbolic that I had to quit a little after the 12 minute mark (about halfway through ""The Virtues of 4chan"" section, which would honestly¬†probably be a better¬†title,¬†because there was nothing really condemning about the site being made or a need to¬†acknowledge 4chan's virtues throughout the video up to this point). I'd love to watch a redux version of this without all the persecution fantasy for 4chan users. You talk about them like they're some marginalized group while at the same time saying that it was originally just an online board for people to talk about anime on. Sure things change over time, but you still talk about how the users of the site were the ""underclass outcasts"" and non-conformists of society with the only background on why that might be being because they like free speech and anime. Honestly the line¬†""begin to take their¬†anger out on the world that made them feel like outcasts"" at 5 minutes in sounds like the tagline to some villain origin story, rather than the righteous change to society the rest of the video attempts to make them seem.

You're so busy applauding the site for being a bastion of free speech that you downplay how it became a hotbed for racism, sexism, reactionary political extreme-ism, child porn, Q-anon eventually, GamerGate, bullying (ironic, since the implications I got from your video describing the users, was that they were the bullied and found refuge in the free speaking world of 4chan), among other things no doubt.

You talk about the big hacks Anonymous was responsible for, but we don't actually get told or shown how big of an effect they had. Church of Scientology is still around, so they didn't kill it, but did they have a lasting effect on it? You talked about the ""pool's closed"" event, but frankly I've barely heard of the website they did it to. There could be many reasons for this, one of which being perhaps Anonymous hurt the website in the public eye enough that it jump started a domino effect leading to people abandoning the site. Or maybe not, maybe something else happened. Did it have a larger cultural impact beyond the site, or was an entry on ""Know Your Meme"" the biggest thing to come out of it? How much did Anonymous actually accomplish, or was the group little more than a technological nuisance for the rich and powerful? 

Nothing was ever mentioned of the events surrounding the PS3's PlaystationStore being hacked, resulting in 77 million users' personal data being accessed, and blamed on Anonymous. This would be clearly an effect Anonymous had on society and could beg the question of, when an activist group is entirely anonymous, how many members need to be involved for the group to be responsible. If we assume the best and believe no one from Anonymous/4chan was involved, then the group was at least big enough of a force that a multi-million dollar company like Sony could throw them under the bus to try to save face for one of the biggest data breaches in history.

I'm not trying to undermine all of the positives you attribute to 4chan, it is an interesting website made up of good and bad parts. It's interesting because it's both, not because it's secretly good in spite of what the mainstream might try to tell you. 

My final point I want to make is about how you attribute Trump's election to the users of 4chan. This, I feel, is strongly ignoring just how much of a presence social media as a whole played in during the 2016 US election. Pepe wasn't just an underground meme used by 4chan anymore, it hadn't been for a long time. I won't say 4chan didn't have an impact on the 2016 election, that would be an incredibly foolish thing to say, but many of the same things were being said by people on other sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. Not to mention Russian intelligence organizations using those

Like I said at the start of this, I think the video's premise is a highly intriguing one. But 4chan's history is simply too controversial and storied than the whitewashed story you tell of it (and that was before the video reached ""The Virtues of 4chan segment""). 4chan has absolutely had large impacts on society as we know it today, but too much feels skimmed, glossed over, exaggerated, or sanitized to truly feel educational. I hope either you or someone else makes a video similar to this one that will feel more informative and is less one-sided and, frankly, pretentious.",[],2021-12-30T12:35:24Z,@thelemonadestandman

4Chan is a cesspit of the crudest, most vulgar and the banal of the society, just a vent for the worst of humanity to discharge all the pent up frustration, rage and stupidity. It‚Äôs no wonder that it is a playground for the far-right outfits of all flavours, sexual predators and the rest of the assorted underworld.

This, too, is a service for the 99% of the population as it gives a safe place to the most apathetical, nihilistic and misanthropic part of the internet to freely express their angst, impotence and inanity in all its glory, all while being furnished with a veil of anonymity which only spurs them on to be as debauched as possible. Much easier to control this rowdy herd by giving them a tiny speck of the internet away from the public‚Äôs eye and let them do there whatever they want than to risk them unleashing their shit on the society in the real world.

"The problem with anonymity (which ties into conspiracy theories, holocaust denying, etc. ) is that the consequences of this spill over into real life, and it just causes too much damage for literally everyone else. People here seem to be of the sentiment that people ""Can post whatever degenerate shit they want and rot away in their apartment. It does not matter"". This is not true. 

It's best illustrated with an example. Let's say I'm an anonymous weeb on a message board and I don't like society, and I don't like people. I'm frustrated, and I want to cause damage. I could go out and protest, commit arson, go postal, or whatever. But that is both risky and limited. I have higher ambitions (or just higher self-worth). I can instead find people who either share my sentiment or are struggling in life, and I can spur them to commit violent acts. 

Finding post that encourages rape on individuals is not that uncommon. There are countless stories of people ending their own life because of encouragement from others. Pre-meditated school shooter posts pop up once in a while, people have a blast with those. Moon as well as everyone else who is intimately familiar with these types of boards knows this. This is not a secret. No shit FBI is monitoring these boards. 

This will cause damage and suffering in real life to individuals and to society at large. People in real life can CLEARLY see that the people ""while acted alone"" were in fact not alone. They had in fact, a support network of (let's face it) terrorists. Society wants accountability, not only for the individuals but for the groups that spur the violence on.

"I just hate school these days. Not because of Education, not because of schoolwork but Homework and social Hierarchy. I won't be talking about Homework since thats a common topic but I will be talking about Social Hierarcy. No one cared who you were back in your first few years of school you either were on the boys or girls side. But as you progressed, popularity was based on how athletic you were like fastest runner was the most popular and stuff. Then it went downhill to how rich or how many ""friends"" do you have? People are equal and shouldn't be shut out because they're not popular or they don't have a lot of friends but thats fine! Having less than Mary from 4th period ELA is ok because you can spend more time with them more often instead of getting crowded constantly by others. For some reason some are well known for having something or being something like for me, I'm known by a good amount of kids in grades higher than me for having a flip phone. Yes, the ones with buttons and not a flip phone iPhone. Someone told me that I would be teased for it but no, I just became well known for it. Listen I never intended nor tried to become a popular kid in school and somehow I'm being noticed by fellow peer. If you want to be popular then go for it! Don't be the one that gets friends just to become popular, actually make friends! Get out of that comfort zone and befriend others and people will know you for being that good person like imagine yourself walking by people saying stuff like ""You're such a good person!"" Wouldn't you feel good that people like you because you are nice? Well if you want that to happen then try to contribute to others, befriend everyone, and work with the goodness in your heart and people will like you more!

"this video seems to treat 4 chan like some kind of big platform.  Yeah, it creates an echo chamber of autism, but does facebook not do the same thing?  And the funny part is, despite having your name tied to facebook, people still post some of the most horrible shit there.  Internet is what you make of it, and humanity is horrible.  You do the math.

Great example.  You mention pepe is this symbol of free speech.  Maybe that is the case for some, in that they feel like pepe is a symbol, but, again, these are the people take 4 chan far too seriously.  In the end, that does mean that 4 chan gets weaponized from time to time, but it's almost like mob mentality.  There's no real direction.
You also miss the fact that 4 chan isn't one ideology.  Go there, and you'll see infighting.  It's a bunch of people with differences of opinions.  A few dozen band together under the flag and it makes this illusion of a big cohesive army, as you are given only one name for EVERYONE (in /b/ and other similar completely anonymous threads), anonymous.

Hell, the simplified point you've been trying to make is overthrown by the Trump era.  Trump's a billionaire.  He stands for the opposite end of everything you claim 4 chan to be about.  Anti establishment?  Yeah, he wasn't a politician prior to his bid for presidency, but he still was the ""establishment.""  At it's heart, 4 chan is a bunch of a kids having fun.  Maybe actual children.  Maybe kids at heart.  But every so often, their laughs line up with a real world issue that resonates with some, who join expecting this big army ready to take on the fight.

"What I'm trying to figure out is: outcasts from what?! Any 4chan user I've seen, society is made by and for older versions of them. It's like incels talking about the exclusion from the fantasy ideals of success that are systemically not meant for the working population. Then lambasting others using the same fantastical standards, in effect bolstering those ridiculous standards only meant to drive consumption and checking out of workers. It's exclusion like that? You didn't get the implicit promised payoff? You, your parents, your grandparents, etc have made a deal with elites that you are being crushed by to not be as oppressed not to be treated well. Now, it doesn't make the majority rich or happy but that's the bargain with the devil. The stuff you're showing me is just kids being provocative for the sake of provocation. Nothing new.

"Trying to depict the history of 4chan as some kind of coherent or pure in spirit ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù and ‚Äúanti-establishment culture is a completely cherry picked and frankly pathetic delusion. You‚Äôre just covering for the fact that 4chan is a recruiting ground for white hate-groups. Pepe the frog / 4chan being linked to both anti-establishment AND a literal president (Trump) completely exposes this hypocrisy. Trump was only popular because he was funny and auth-right. 

So that‚Äôs your video. 4chan is humorous and auth-right, mostly fusing the two but sometimes distinct between boards. 

The entire section leading up to the 15-minute mark cloaking hate-speech as a necessary freedom that allows peoples ‚Äúdark side‚Äù to be expressed is so fucking telling how tangled the terminally online 4chan psychosis goes.","['So /v/, /a/, /fit/, hell /tg/ are recruiting white hate groups? Have you ever actually been on 4chan? The only board you\'ll find that shit is on /pol/ and even then if YOU are going in looking for it well guess what you\'ll find it. Who would have thought if you try looking for something that goes along with your beliefs will lead to others with the same beliefs. It\'s the same shit if you go on Twitter and get into those retarded lefty socialist communist groups. \n\nEvery site has their retards but in the end of the day if i go on /v/ or whatever board and just wanna talk about video games or whatever well guess what i won\'t see some Jack""ss trying to recruit me to a hate group.', '@@SoggyBurrit0 bro I spent too much time on many of those boards. Gamer gate had such a huge fuckin fallout in /v/ and that, although not white supremacist explicitly, was definitely a very bigoted time on /v/ and a precursor to the /pol/ era. And like, ‚Äú/pol/ is leaking‚Äù is a saying for a reason. ‚ÄúIf you go looking for it‚Äù ignores the very casual ways bigotry infects the conversations and communities on other boards. It‚Äôs a verifiable and reported fact that white supremacy groups recruit/troll on 4chan on sfw boards as well as /b/ or /pol/. To me, it‚Äôs a phenomenal study in how hate tried to play itself off as ‚Äútrolling‚Äù and irony only to become more and more sincere. Look, I enjoyed the parts of the community that stayed immunized against casual hatred like /sci/ and /fit/, and I don‚Äôt hold being on the website against anyone. But we have to talk about the problem of 4chan harboring this stuff, we can‚Äôt just pretend a place, where cp gets posted is off limits because it‚Äôs only certain board. It‚Äôs great to talk about 4chan, SOPA, Aaron Schwartz, and all these things but we have to talk about 4chans other progeny, so things  /pol/ and 8chan, etc. this video is too valorizing and uncritical of a nuanced topic.']",2021-12-22T16:17:36Z,@CocoaBeanWhip

What is the American people\'s liberty, if a liberated person\r\ndecides they should no longer be liberated and you deny it, then you are therefore denying their liberty\r\nmaking them not liberated in the first place.

I advocate for the social state, one in which society is a cohesive system, I advocate for the dismantling of racial tension, by simply separating them from eachother, so that they may rule over their own, for their own, I advocate for a solution to economic strife by ridding ourselves of the global financial system and the elites that hold power over us, you may call it idealist, but I certainly wouldn\'t say its inherently violent.  It is true that the truth can be twisted, that is why its important to allow people to speak, as you never know if the ""truth"" you have is manipulated.

"As someone who was at ground zero for much of this, I think it's worth mentioning that a lot of us who set these things in motion, a lot of the people who created the rise of the Internet meme and the glorification of original content (read: ""free expression""), a lot of the best parts of 4chan actually hate something specific about what happened to it.

There's a reason the memes aren't coming out of there the way that they used to. The creative minds of 4chan thrived on a culture that didn't take ANY of it too seriously, and the loudest part of 4chan has lost that type of edge. This is symbolized by the title of the most used board on 4chan switching from /b/ to /pol/, and it lines up well with how ""The Golden Age of the Internet is Over,"" an elaboration of how people stopped doing things on the Internet for pure fun and started doing things for an agenda. We haven't heard of 4chan doing things purely ""for the lulz"" in ages, and that's really what a lot of us miss. Sadly, I don't see any of that coming back in a big way any time soon.","['This. 4chan is only running on fumes of past creativity.', 'Yea, I can agree with this.

However, people can't be held accountable if they are anonymous.

The conclusion was naturally opinionated, as is traditionally the case.

"i find it so depressing that it seems like the only political content coming from this last bastion of the ""old internet"" (meaning an unmoderated forum-like site) seems to be so primitive. its potential could be great, but all i've been seeing in the past years is mostly populist, alt-right and sometimes even fascist content and ideology.

i understand that people are ""anti-establishment"", since they are not being heard. but a frustration with corporate neoliberal structures should point you in the direction of critique towards the powers that put this into place: conservatives. not into the same old stupid hatred against some scapegoat, be it other races, religions, or ideas.

i feel like in the trump rallies there is absolutely nothing left of the spirit that wanted to bring down things like scientology. they ignore that ""funny troll guy"" is a fucking millionaire; and he's gonna help the little man?

i realize that politics in the US are some of the most distorted and economically influenced things there are. it's just a shame that the weebs and autists don't realize becoming a bully yourself (that is, a nazi) will only worsen everything. some things about the ""establishment"", meaning things that are commonly accepted - are good - humanism, respect for human rights, dignity and a society where all are seen as equals. i'm aware that this is sadly not in place; but that's not your arab neighbor's fault. it's politics enslaved by relentless uncontrolled capitalist interest.

"i mean i agree with a lot of the points made in the video especially with the need for free speech part. but i disagee with living in a society where free speech is something that is not allowed anymore. obviously like you stated large corporations censor stuff but i think there is more to the world than the internet and at least where i live you can express yourself. 

calling all millenials and gen-z people manipulated is also incredibly wrong. i think a lot of young people just have a hard time tolerating people who are intolerant and therefor are a danger to a healthy society.

also the part about trump being the huge troll i strongy disagree with, he was just another greedy old dude in a seemingly never ending string of people in politics for their own financial gain.

"Taking a controversial stance doesn't automatically qualify a person as smart or 'thinking for themselves'. Most trolls, like most hackers, appropriate ideas and code created by people a LOT smarter than they could ever be so that they themselves may appear smart...they are not capable of writing the code they use OR possessing an original thought. The best the chimpanzees can do is clap, hoot and holler 'That's what I'm talking about' when the ones they idolise manage a little sardonic wit or a warped perspective they themselves were totally incapable of conceiving.
MOST of these 'Flat-Earthers', Anti-Vaxers, Trumptards are absolute, ABSOLUTE, morons who think that because they adopt a view that is shared by a very small minority that automatically qualifies them as Avant-Garde, Revolutionary and Geniuses...when in reality the truth is much more mundane....they never amounted to anything, they could never grasp fundamental concepts all for the simple reason that they where NEVER EVER ABLE TO GATHER ENOUGH GUMPTION TO SEE SOMETHING THROUGH TO COMPLETION. It's much easier to steal or vandalize someone else's work than adding any worthy contribution themselves.
It's ironic that most of these Trolls are actually the biggest Users and Consumers of all. A bunch of NOOBS appropriating other people's code, other people's Internet, other people's Technology AND OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS, things they could NEVER HOPE to be capable of creating themselves, as their own. They vandals of society are WORSE than failures...these 'individuals' seek to burn the world down...at least failures innocuously have no impact.

"20:11 Wait was the guy the owner or another family/person? If another person was the owner, I don‚Äôt see a reason why they should punish them, I agree with that they should give the cat medical attention but taking someone‚Äôs else‚Äôs pet away without reason could mentally impact them as well, what if the cat was actually very loved? Just because they gave the cat freedom to run around doesn‚Äôt mean they are bad but of course I also see why this could be bad since it was tiny and shouldn‚Äôt have been let out for at least a year

 (Positive story time to light up the mood a bit and to explain why this is exactly my view: I also have a cat and the person we got her from told us something like that, by the time we got my cat she was only 1 year old so we didn‚Äôt let her roam around freely but instead went out with her to let her adjust a bit to our environment for sometime till she was ready, the time we lived in our previous home we mostly let her out around evening after she had adjusted though I was concerned honestly because she was still pretty young and me as a child had so many far fetched negative thoughts about event that could occur in mind, if my cat would not return till dawn I would usually start crying üòÖ, she did eventually return. In recent times we had moved to a flat with a balcony separated from the ground and right behind a street so we don‚Äôt let her outside anymore besides on the balcony,  we kinda made it cat-safe so she could roam around freely without us worrying that something might happen to her or she would escape, I doubt she would be able to survive alone, that cat eats like two entire cat food bowls a day and she is literally scared by everything, it would be better if she stayed with us üòÇ)",[],2024-11-10T01:26:26Z,@NotM3li

"25:00 I've spent my entire life in a ranch town, I was a farm kid and so were most of my friends and family. Yes, the reality of working with animals is that sometimes, animals, even the cute ones, have to die to prevent them further suffering be it from disease, an injury, a lack of ability to care for them, and that, especially in rural or impoverished areas, you can't pay the hundreds of dollars in vet bills and travel costs every time to get them put down properly. Yeah, a gun is the go-to here, but not everyone has access to that, and burying them alive, drowning, or blunt force is usually what people go to next. It's awful. It's awful for the animal, it's awful for the people who have to do it. _That's_ what's fucked about the video. I grew up with old cowboys and soldiers who made it part of their personality to never shed a tear at a damn thing, who cried like babies when they had to put down animals. Sure, now that we're older and years removed from it, we might make a couple of dark jokes, but in the moment, it is a fucking gut wrenching act to have to do, even if you know it's for the best in the long run. It's sociopathic, and especially at that young of an age to have that little respect for life.",[],2024-06-24T02:11:59Z,@Leo-wh1st

Are you completely ignorant about the ongoings on farms across the globe? You think the vet is called everytime a cat delivers a litter that the farmer doesn't want? Or the dog?
Of course she shouldn't have posted a video about it and looking like they're having fun doing it looks bad (totally), but please get real. On any farm, the relationship to most of the animals is not one of love or ""friendship"". Mostly, it's sort of a working relationship. If you kill the mice and rats, I'll keep you here. Puppies, chickens (male in particular) and kittens are killed daily on farms if they're not needed or wanted. I surely couldn't do it, but I'm not a farmer.

"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead- murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time - something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange - uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" - on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",[],2024-05-27T20:59:44Z,@intdisaster

"""I made a mistake but my life should not be defined by it"". Everyone's life's are defined by their mistakes as much as their successes. what you don't learn from family, friends, teachers, etc growing up, you learn by making mistakes. We were always told at my school growing up ""try and try again until you succeed"". If we are defined only by successes then there are alot of spotless individuals. We only succeed because we learned from our failures and mistakes (which basically turns them into successes). Problem is, abusing an animal isn't just a ""mistake"", it's just f*cking nuts, like seek psychological help nuts (and this is coming from someone who had a psychosis and thought the process church was trying to brainwash them). Like, just no, it's not ""a mistake"", it's not something anyone is capable of, it's just sick in the head. Wtf.",[],2024-04-17T00:43:38Z,@EldritchRoots

"@letstalkfiction5187 i can't respond in your thread so I'm writing here.

OK 2 things:


There is racism and racism, one is just words and oversensitive reactions. But no phisucal harm done.

So examples are someone reacting to jokes... Have some humor, and even if you don't have any, at the and of the day they are just words. And newsflash everyone gets insulted. Age, race, clothing, body type, work, etc etc.... Deal with it.

Other example you don't get a job because you're colored. OK then fk em and go get another job... And here again other factors are being discriminated too, age, religion, size etc.... And yeah they won't tell you, they just say they found someone with more experience.

Now if racism involves physical harm that's a different story as with anything else. Physical harm. Is unacceptable. Period. But you have at least a chance.

Where innocent animals can't fight back, they have no chance. And at the end of the day these are the type of people that will come after you and your loved ones, so be effin happy that this is being fought against. And show some compassion geez, do you think it's a, sign of toughnedd harming someone who cannot defend themselves? It's cowardly.",[],2024-01-11T09:31:20Z,@szilvusa

"Regarding the girl who threw puppies, I can confirm, as a person from an Eastern European country, that in rural areas it's more common to get rid of puppies/kittens by drowning them. The sad reality is that most likely these people have fewer possibilities to sterilize their pets, well, at least I know this was the case like 15-20 years ago. To avoid dog packs or cats spread, people would rather prefer to kill newborns. I remember when I was still like 6 years old or so, one of my relatives talked about how they needed to get rid of the kittens of their cat. It was harsh to hear, but I couldn't really do anything about that. Those relatives are not evil by any means, they love their pets. But I guess living in a farm/rural area makes you less sensitive to such things. 
By that I do not defend the girl, screaming ""Wheeee!"" while killing those animals is helluva weird. My relatives were never happy about it even tho they had done such a thing in the past.","['Still weird shit.', ""Thing is, it's not even that uncommon in western world, at least again, 10-20 years ago.  Rural life is what it is, which is often rough and ugly"", 'as an eastern european living in some unknown countryside, what the actual fuck??', 'im from romania which is in eastern europe and lots of people especially in smaller towns and villages do this to their pets, i know its harsh and i have a big empathy for animals, especially cats, but vets and adoption centers are rarer there', 'Even if this is the easiest and quickest way to deal with these kinds of things when proper animal care is not readily available/affordable, showing the glee the girl did is just messed up.

i know legally speaking animals are property and not people and for the most part that does make sense, but someone destroying a hotel room doesnt have the same connotation as animal abuse. it's been common knowledge for ages now that animal abusers do much worse things later in life. if someone starts a fire they arent just punished for the little damage they did inflict if the fire was put out early enough, but what the intention was and what they endangered. same goes for animal abuse, if that's just an early stage for psychopathic mass murder, it should be punished as that. preventive justice IS protecting the people and that's what justice is for.",[],2023-11-30T21:56:39Z,@nevermindmeijustinjectedaw9988

A ‚Äúmistake‚Äù happens accidentally and not intentionally.
A ‚Äúmistake‚Äù arises from misjudgment and not from enjoying suffering.

"Reminds me of a time when I was younger at a sports camp the camp had a thing where we would run 10 laps around the campus in the morning. During one of the runs I saw a bat crawl around on the ground in broad daylight and thought it was weird so I told another kid at that camp to get an adult to see if they could help it, instead the kid called other kids over and stoned the poor bat to the death. I was 8 years old then and it traumatized me that I remember almost every bit of what happened, I screamed for them all to stop but they didn‚Äôt.

I'm not sure if I can even START this video. I've wanted to take care of reptiles for my entire life, and I love turtles and tortoises more than almost any other animal.

I hope (s)he's in tortoise heaven. No creature deserves that.


The takeaway of this video, on more watching, is that law enforcement is incompetent and uncaring on these matters, and the law does not do enough to stop animal abusers from repeat offences.

"A few hours ago, I walked into the kitchen and discovered that one of my family's dogs was pregnant and we had not known because she neither looked pregnant or acted pregnant. We had tried to keep the male dog away from our female dogs,  but my siblings kept putting them in the same pen after I told them not to.  There were 3 puppies, and their sacs had not been chewed open by their mom. Sadly, they did not survive.  I'm used to this happening because my mom is a dog breeder and some of the puppies do not make it, probably because we have small dogs. I wish she wouldn't wouldn't breed dogs, I'm the only one taking care of them but I'm also responsible for everything else in the house. I don't think it's fair to the dogs and I hate how she does this for the money because these are small dogs and their size is likely the reason so many of the puppies keep dying when they are born. The moms are not big enough to safely have these puppies without c-sections, and some of them have birth-defects or are born dead. I've saved a lot of these puppies, but I can't save them all. There isn't much I can do about it because I am a minor and I try my best to seperate the dogs so none of them get pregnant, but I am not able to prevent it every single time because we have so many dogs and I am very busy. I am a minor and I can't get our dogs spayed or anything. People that abuse animals like this make me sick.

It was in the news in my city (in Newfoundland, Canada) and there was sooooo much media coverage for getting the people who had led to the cat's death to be charged and sent to jail. If I recall right, they did end up going to jail- or at the very least defintiely charged.

"It's important to realize the truth, rather than what you've been told. 
4chan isn't a bad place, and people to go to 4chan aren't all bad people. It is a place of predominantly free speech, there are a few restrictions, but for the most part you're allowed to say whatever the hell you want, and usually it's the other users that police it in the way most of society does it, where if someone says something the rest of the people don't like, the people will usually tell them or lash back at them. 
If you go to /a/ and yell about how much you hate anime in the threads, you're gonna get your shit kicked in. 
And permabans are few and far between.
Channer's are just normal people with vastly varying interests, only they have freedom of speech. Legitimate crimes posted to these boards are usually permabanned and reported to the authorities, and when not, the users do their best to do what vigilante work they can. 
We don't all just think ""I'm going to doxx and ruin some random persons entire life for shits and giggle."" 
Instances like these, where 4chan takes justice into their own hands, are VERY rare, and the instance when an anon does something evil is even rarer.
Chances are someone you know goes to 4chan, because 99.9% of us just want to talk about our interests to other like minded people. Toys /toy/, table top games /tg/, video games /v/ or /vg/, anime /a/, fashion /fa/, guns /k/, the outdoors /out/, animals and nature /an/, sports /sp/ or /xs/, paranormal stuff /x/. 
There's no /dox/ board, where you post and talk about all the info you've gathered on your current target, or /hax/ where you post and talk about what private devices you've hacked into.

"There's a lot I agree and disagree with how 4Chan works. I agree with how they do things, finding evidence, going to the police, and even trying to get the animals away from the person harming them.

What I don't agree with is how they doxx people and how they threaten and even send d*ath threats to these people and even personally share information about the person(s) in question.

And how many times was mention that 4Chan mistakenly got the wrong person and falsely accused them for ab*se again? 4-5 mabe more that was mentioned? Like...couldn't 4Chan or people running it go to jail for doing something bad too? Because last time I checked most states in America will fine you, jail you or both on threatening other users, bullying, and harassing them as well. You can even go to jail for falsely accusing someone too if that person were to file a police report.

I agree with spreading the awareness of it, but their being waaayyyy over dramatic and being so aggressive and even dangerous about it too. They leak PERSONAL information about MINORS. This is bad as people could show up to his/her house and do god knows what to these people. That is BAD. I agree with 4Chan that justice needs to be served, but I don't agree with leaking personal information which is against the law in most states in America, bullying, harassing or threatening people which are all also against the law. 

So as someone who pays attention to the law...this is bad to be doing let alone dementarting. There are such better and kinder ways to get someone put into jail. You don't need to leak or have a board/gang/mass of people behind the scenes leaking this type of personal information about an individual or multiple people who were involved. The only people that should be leaking personal information is the f*cking police and the News. That's it. No one else should be going about their way to put people in danger. Even if they are bad. Because like I stated before 4Chan is known to accidently accuse the wrong person and have hate sent to them even though they were innocent the whole time.

If I was someone part of 4Chan I would address this and address articles about laws in certain states and being like ""We need to do better or else we can go to jail ourselves based off of the gov sites made about laws in each state in America."" 

Like...4Chan needs to do better with being nicer and not being unstable and just blindly going after people and sending threats and personally information and having people from the 4Chan doxxing or trolling or bullying and even harassing the people in question. Like come on people do better....Seriously. 

Also I feel very bad and even sad and heartbroken that each animal fell victim to these horrible, horrible people. I hope the animals that were harmed either r.i.p or have better homes and are treated with the care and respect they deserve. No animal should ever be unhappy or put through pain or be neglected. If you or someone else sees animal ab*se please don't go to the 4Chan reported to Animal Control and get police involved ASAP. The sooner the better the police have the case the more time the animal has to live and get taken away from an ab*sive home. As someone who loves and owns pets myselves I couldn't sit here and wait for 4Chan to come in and be my hero. Sometimes we have to take the initiative to do it ourselves and save an animal. So please if you see animal ab*se happening report it right away and not to 4Chan. Also if your someone who can't keep care of an animal please do not release that animal or hurt it or harm it or anything. Do your best on either taking it to a shelter or trying to give it away to friends, another family member or even to people around where you live. Animals deserve better. So please make sure every animal deserves a good loving family and home and safe environment.","[""Did you really fucking just wrote multiple paragraphs on the negativity of 4chan?\n4chan?

Causes for dark circles: Lack of sleep. Natural thinning of the under eye skin. Dehydration. Smoking. Dilation of the blood vessels in the under eye area. Tips for under eye circles. Getting more rest. Making sure to drink the required amount of water daily. Try using a cold compress to restrict the dilated blood vessels darkening the area once a week. Dampen a tea bag and  place on effected areas once a week. Like a spa day! Always read the ingredients of eye creams because they may actually make the circles worse.

"I think the laws have a few flaws in them. I still think parents should be held accountable for their minors but some type of mental health analysis is to be done too to make sure they're not actually a psychopath. Some killers normally start with animal abuse. So in the case of the girls in the beginning, they got off easy. But I think united states is normally pretty good at charging as either minor or adult. I do however think there's specific situations where the parents are liable too. But in the case of the puppy thrower, it is weird that the girl did get some enjoyment out of it or sounded like it. Again, mental health analysis should be needed. The rest just seemed like immature teens who eventually got what they deserved.

"Old video, but I did want to post some info here when it comes to the Puppy Thrower video.

Back in the day (and even today in certain places or in instances where the practice has been passed down) people used to drown unwanted pups if their dog got pregnant.  Usually they would try to home as many of them as they could before resorting to this.  The thought was that if the dogs were allowed to roam they would either become feral and dangerous or slowly die of hunger since they were domesticated and didn't know how to hunt.  (The practice was mainly in rural and farmlands where unlike in cities there wasn't a lot of garbage the dogs could go through to find scraps).  The ones doing the drowning saw this as a mercy compared to a slow death.

I don't condone the practice but I can understand the thought behind it, especially back in the day when transportation was different and there weren't things like pounds in their area.  

My only real thought would be why would you subject them to drowning?  If you wanted them to not suffer then wouldn't a quick killing have been more humane?

Thankfully today the practice isn't as wide spread as it used to be and there are more organizations people can rely on to re home unwanted animals.",[],2023-02-08T04:52:48Z,@SakuraShirakawa

One day they were getting ready to slaughter a chicken for a BBQ, nothing unusual about that of course but the at the crack of dawn, they zip tied the chicken‚Äôs legs together and stuffed it in a garbage bag where they left it for 8 hours before slaughtering it. When I told them that it was animal cruelty they laughed and said this is how you kill chickens. Then there‚Äôs the boats that go down the mara√±on river into the Amazon where they keep hundreds of monkeys in tiny cages and slaughter them inhumanely in front of the other monkeys throughout the journey, causing them even more distress. It all comes down to a catholic ideal of humans having dominion over animals that isn‚Äôt ever questioned in their society, I‚Äôve asked numerous people about it and every response I got was that it was perfectly fine, they‚Äôre just animals.",[],2023-01-08T19:15:39Z,@suboptical2732

However, one day, my grand dad found something like a kitten's head in the backyard and speculated it was cannibalised by its own family. A few others weren't so lucky either. They all passed away due to some kind of sickness. But don't worry, one of them was alive as it was treated by the vet. This went on for a while until one day, the mother cat never come back again for a long while. My mom had suggested that the mother cat was probably killed by a stray dog or something.

"I mean their vigilante efforts can only reveal someone‚Äôs name and location. Everything is hearsay afterwards. They incorrectly harassed so many others and in the end, they can only discover someone and it should be noted how often animals die by the hands of abuse and nothing comes of it in terms of justice. 
  Dark deb reveals a lot as well as this is just what has a camera and something posted. Tons of abuse happens outside of this and if you want real change unlike peta who does nearly nothing beside smooch up to bush then maybe start with the law first or how even a witness/viewer should be punished if they don‚Äôt report it. None of us can change or prevent it. Maybe consequences and gov can help deter or get more justice otherwise it just seems like a big dox flex which don‚Äôt require real skills outside of baseline sleuthing.

We also completely assume truth in a few comments that these people were ostracized when in reality we have no clue if more than a few knew or even gave a fuck. 4chan is just another odd cult online and sleuthing helps as creepy as the process is but it rarely results in justice.

Hard to tell without knowing the girl, their actual situation and any cultural quirks in that area. 

Not defending her but just noticed Wavy said a few times he couldn't understand how someone could joke while doing such an act. It's actually surprisingly common. Why you have people joking at their executions or when they in extreme pain. 

And there is no defending the filming and uploading of the act. If you have to kill them, just do it and be done with it. Don't film it and for gods sake don't share it online.

"The last case has some very insightful quotes I need to share regarding the condition N.P.D, which both of these boys probably have.

""I hate you...do you hate me"" is the first one, and it's the inner monologue a person with N.P.D has daily; the root of it is for them to seek validation in their own self-hatred. They feel hate for themselves, that's why they hate the world. But if they can get the world to hate them back, it validates the original hate. The only way to break this cycle is by compassion. That is why the death penalty is wrong, and preventative measures need to be in place to prevent N.P.D

""I will kill you"" is the second quote in the second video. This shows that yes, N.P.D will go all the way with their abuse, if you are being slightly abused by someone - you can bet they will probably go all the way if you don't stop it.

"The Katja case is awful but to add perspective as someone who has grown up rurally the act of culling animals is a much more differently looked down upon subject where in rural areas compared to urban, as in a rural area the  idea of things like animal abuse has a significantly different percieved meaning . Long ago acts like self culling were more common because of the severe inconvenience caused from having to get a veterinarian to come out or to go to. Even today I hear grizzly stories which people don't seem to care that much about. But that is also because farm animals and urban pets are also somewhat different. Sure there are people like me who love animals, but I do see the difference on a outdoor cat that has been inbreeding for several generations to the point where they just are not the same. Even the death of an animal is differently received as where I am people will witness the death of livestock, coyotes, foxes, and even small domestic animals like cats. So not out sourcing the death may save you money and time on a sick or lethally wounded animal getting the same outcome, though more barbaric.

"Dusty's horrible case reminded me of the Peluchin case, Peluchin was a chilean teen, who was youtuber, and who murdered his own poor cat with his bare hands, by trowing him into a closet, hitting him repeatly with his fists and with a bat if I remember correctly, the video was also disturbing to see, cause you could hear the poor cat's cries for help, and the spychopath beated the cat so hard, that the poor cat's back broke...This happened back in december of 2018, wich is the date of where he upload it the horrendous video, wich he delated in 2019. I unfortunately saw the heinous video, and I've never cried as hard as I did that day....that poor cat....I felt rage boiling inside of me and I wished the teen really horrible deaths and I wished that the same happened to him. The backlash resulted in that the police arrested him, but he wasn't charge cause in Chile, they can't put a minor in jail, so he was sended to a spychiatric facility to treat his ovboius spychopathy, he was 15 at the time he horribly killed his cat, whose name was Jaso Killer, odd name I know...Fourtunately his channel was delated by YouTube on the 29th of September of 2020, but he unfortunately came back in 2021 with a new channel. And after the horrondous act he did, he adopted two kitties, who he threw in a toilet, the kitties fortunately weren't harm, and the words he said regarding of what happened to his poor cat, well he lied instead of adimitting that he killed his OWN cat, he lied saying that the animal, died of an illness, when that was FALSE, HE killed the cat, IT WAS HIM! I was FURIOUS when I read what he said and the fact that EVERYONE knew what really happened to the poor animal, cause literally everyone in the world knew what he did to the cat....So yeh, I got some flashbacks of that case....",[],2022-12-06T19:10:56Z,@hamakochan375kj

"My old neighbour used to abuse her bunny rabbit. Her kid used to come around to play with my little sister and told me stories about her mum hurting the rabbit to punish her. Lifting it by the ears, throwing it and starving it. 
 I could see into their garden by going into my allotment and scaling the fence. I told my mother, and for a few days we surveyed the rabbit hutch, noting no one from the house fed it for 8 days! Dont worry, we climbed the fence and fed/water the poor lonely bunny each night when dark.
By day 11, my mom got fedup of the rspca not following up. The hutch was filthy and tiny. So she sent me and my sister around to distract the mom and daughter, whilst she scaled the fence and took bunny.
She left the cage wide open. It stayed that way for 5 more days until the mother noticed and closed it again. But she didnt clean it or ask anyone about her rabbit. I guess she assumed it escaped and was somewhere dead in the disgusting dump of a garden?

We kept Bunny for 6 yrs and bought him a buddy. If you're wondering about the lil girl, she never was invited back into our back garden and instead played in the front. We were all sworn to secrecy and never said a word! 
The mom was later arrested and the lil girl was sent to live with her nan.","['Damn, that‚Äôs crazy.

In the first case, you completely skim over the father receiving death threats. 
In the second case - you talk about a long stalking campaign over a tasteless joke like it was some genuine attempt at justice.
I assure you that while SOME few people might've acted out of concern for the animals - the people who called PETA, the people who analyzed pictures to find adresses and the people who harrassed the families - they did it for the sole purpose of fucking with people.
I know, because I used to be one of those pieces of shit as a teenager. I was lonely, jaded and I was happy to participate in these internet campaigns against anyone who was designated as a target.

The demographic of the particular imageboard that I frequented wasn't very patriotic at all, and didn't have a lot of respect for human life.
And yet, when some 14 year old kid posted a video online mocking a recent national tragedy where a head of state died - everyone was more than eager to contact the kid's parents, classmates, his teachers and his school's principal in an attempt to get him in trouble, or scare him at least. The video the kid posted was exactly the same sort of mockery that you'd see on our imageboard. So, why did we do it?


Because it didn't matter if the targets actions were in line with mine or the hivemind's worldview. The thing that mattered was - could we exploit this persons actions to get them in trouble?

3.) since nothing is known really, it's hard to say. his friends are trash af tho too. ig you really do attract the same people as yourself. you are who you hangout with could also be true. Seems like he really needed more mental health based shit rather than jail. 
4.) I don't know how outside elements work or Bosnia gov in general to say anything.
5.) Now would be a good time to look into the oil company and lawton sheriff dept and cops in-depth. they should have had a stay placed on their punishment in terms of the legal system. ik y'all have heard of the town or surrounding county before for some similar fuckery. the kids didn't learn, and the parents didn't care. point black period. 

so many small town fucks, like if you live in a city you know you'd get your ass beat and the neighborhood as a whole wouldn't fuck with you. they've never had to endure hard times or real consequences. I can't believe they had with the immaturity and cruelty. 1 is even shittier when you consider that they fucking stole an endangered animal for this. they could have put him back. this wasn't about not being responsible or knowing better, they really went out of their way. the circuit court sounds sus af too.",[],2022-11-23T00:56:47Z,@kittygoesWOOF

"When I was a very young child, I had a tabby cat who used to have a tail. His tail got ran over by a car and was horribly bent. When I saw it getting worse, I screamed and cried to my mom, begging her to take the injured cat to save his life. Fast forward, he was taken to the vet and had surgery to have his tail removed. After all of that he was completely okay and lived a long good life for the past decade until he passed away in 2021 at an old age due to cancer. And my grey cat, he was abandoned until we adopted him. He had a good life and was really close friends with my tabby cat. He also passed away in his sleep this year because he was very old. I miss them both and I love them dearly. Other timestamps, disgusted. Now Dusty and the Tortoise, my blood boiled insanely hard. I was punching the air and my bed when I heard about this. I'm so angry.

"If Katja was the puppy thrower, her explanation for what she did is utterly ridiculous. Drowning is not a quick death to any animal, it's actually the most distressing thing that can happen to a mammal (not sure about other animals). It was scientifically proven that lack of oxygen triggers the most primal, the most motivating fear there is, that even people with amygdala damage, unable to feel fear under most circumstances, can experience. Drowning makes you fight for your life till the very end, it's not a quick death. If you had to euthanize them yourself, without bringing them to a vet (which is understandable, given how expensive those visits can be) the most ethical course of action would be to crush their heads with a heavy stone, or snap their necks in such a way to kill them instantly, without paralyzing them that is.

"I think that Katja who was living in a rural area of where the crime was taken thought that it was normal in her eyes thats why she filmed it, she might have thought it was just funny and the weeee sound was because the puppies were flying and he was making that noise. I do believe her story, it sounds plausible due to the location and the farmgirl thing wavy said. I'm not trying to argue, its just my opinion on what happened. I agree that westerners will be pissed at stuff like this and that shouldnt be shown on youtube. But she obviously didn't know youtube's guidelines and was probably new to yt. btw just think of all the animal abuse which occurs behind the cameras, 4chan can't help that but I'm happy that they can guide and help situations. They helped and made sure Katja would never do that again on camera. The dogs were ill as she said and it makes sense in a rural point. In other rural countries, like korea, people hit dogs with hammers and its showed on yt. Tell me, is that not animal abuse, I can see that in factories, people harm animals in a safer and painless way. But stuff like this does happen. 4chan is the best.

"On the River Puppy thing: I have seen this actually happen in croatia. With kittens. It is a sad fact that many farmers have pets that they do not know how to keep, and just let them roam around, unfixed, and multiply. And to deal with the resulting offspring: They tend to throw them in the nearest river. My relatives used to do this, until my mother got fed up with one, paid for them to be taken to the nearest vet and be fixed, so they don't wildly reproduce. 

The sad reality is: Animals like dogs and cats are viewed as utensils. Tools. You often see dogs be kept on a short chain, something entirely forbidden in germany, but widely used in croatia. On the one hand: Farmers need a guard dog to protect their livelyhood, on the other hand: They often can not train a dog, so the best option they see is this.

And unfortunately: This is unlikely to change. These farmers are isolated, old and set in their way. There is little chance they will change their mind on this.",[],2022-11-12T20:48:38Z,@bass-dc9175

"Say what you will about 4chan, hell I've said things too...

Think people who don't fix their pets then take a bag of kittens to the woods and leaves. As we live in the woods we see this fairly often. One person on a quad flat out dropped off a bag of kittens in the woods near our house and we saw them. We sadly couldn't report as we didn't get a good look, only seeing them act of dropping off what we thought was trash on our land and so when we went to clean it up there was 5 yound kittens not 3 weeks old crying for help. People like this make me sick.

P.S. because I know people will ask, all the kittens have found loving homes including the runt of the group who has been living with us as of me writing this for 2 months.

He also ""hacks"" into cctv of their bureau, does an investigation months until he have every name, connection, past of scamming AND WHERE THEIR BUREAU IS so all information Indian police would need there are all. Yet they still don\'t nothing because a) cast system, b) coruption and connections. If you scam Europeans and Ameriacns you make 15-20x minimal indian wage so I imagine buying police department isn\'t big cost for whole ""company"". Jim also revealed how much they make. and it depends on scale but even to $10mln USD for 120 people ($80k per year in India is money like 500k $/euro, ofc boss makes 2-3mln of it. These dumpa$$es post pictures of new houses, card etc. and in their IRS he works in construction. Dude doing all that for free but patreon, god bless him. That\'s perfect example for grey hacker, even though he does more good than 99.9% of people having saved millions usd and want nothing for it. If he went live with his name and face he\'d face federal charges.', 'Also what\'s crazy for me is they use TeamViewer like app (which gives someone control over your computer which you should never do unless it\'s someone very close who you trust like family or boyfriend or IT guy. no Microsoft or amazon would ask you to download app which takes away control over your computer and they even make your screen black so you can\'t even see what they are going.) But thing with TeamViewer type apk is that it usually works both ways. He can come to my pc, look photos, games, yt subscription etc. but I can format his system as we are speaking or get access to cctv/their FILES OF EVERYONE THEY SCAMMED WHEN, HOW MUCH AND IF PERSON IS STILL WILLING TO PAY in few months, anyway they don\'t even encrypt that stupid folder whih classifies them as federal offense.

"YET again YouTube thinks my comment ,I'll just save elsewhere, contains an ""invalid argument"" swear that's up to me and apparently others if it's an argument. 
Censorship much?

It wasn't arguing now I am somehow in this comment. How can a comment written by yourself that isn't even posted yet be an argument? If I'm going to argue with myself either way I'm going to win it be rather pointless. Most arguments don't have clear ""winners"" anyhow. Since I have not developed multiple personalities within myself to argue with I'll post my thoughts on YouTube then get an automated message hurled that a comment contains an invalid argument. How it was never posted...

Where are you pulling argument from in that feature, YouTube? Person hasn't posted.

 Your staff seems to have video strikes to address better review, Google after all making Trillion networth wise billions from creators on YouTube platform working on making your process transparent and hire more staff to review cases not block comments before they are posted. The community will decide to if it's an ""argument"" or the creator can decide to remove the comment or disable comments all together. Ok, now I'm arguing amongst myself it seems....whatever.

Stated an observation a perspective that is weird YouTube is arguing.....anyhow couldn't finish this video not mad 4Chan an open forum (think that it is) I know little about decided to be an advocate for abused animals that clearly don't have a voice.

"Several years ago I rescued a kitten that was being abused by a couple of boys. They were out in the street and throwing the kitten like a football trying to see how far they could throw it. The kitten got away and hid under our car, so the boys eventually moved on. The next ,morning I heard the kitten crying and called it and it came running up and I brought it inside. I took the kitten to the vet and fortunately it wasn't physically injured, just traumatized. We named him Doodles (Cheese Doodles) were ""playing with"" the day before. The kitten was orange and we had an adult cat who was almost exactly like the kitten, so we showed those boys that cat and told them that was the only orange cat we had seen. We kept the kitten and he lived a long happy life.
We rescued several abused kitties over the years, including 2 from the same person. The boy had one kitten and he got mad because it scratched him and he threw it at their picnic table where it hit with a loud thump. Another kitten he had trapped in the foundation vent well and was trying to drown it with the garden hose turned on full blast. Let's just say that I have ways of making helpless animals disappear into safer environments.
There was a lot of animal abuse in our neighborhood for awhile. I got one guy arrested. He HATED cats and would run then over if he could. Couldn't get him on those, but then one day the kids from across the street brought over a bag of kitten food and asked if I wanted it because they didn't need it anymore. I asked them what happened to their kitten and they told me that the man had shot the kitten in the head, while it was on my property....in front of the kids! I asked them if they would be willing to tell the police what had happened and they said yes. I called and a police officer came and took their statements as well as listening to my story about him running his truck into my yard to try and run down my kitty. It wasn't too long after that that the police showed up and arrested him for illegally discharging a firearm in.side city limits, animal abuse and I think they also got him for child endangerment for shooting the kitten in front of them. 
I often wish that Justice World was a real thing. In Red Dwarf, the British scifi comedy, the drew lands on Justice world. There whatever you tried to do would happened to you and not the intended victim., for instance, they tried setting something on fire andtheir pants burst into flame. They escaped the villain by taunting him into shooting them, which of course the bullet hit and killed him instead. Every one of these abusers should have to suffer the same fate as the animal they tortured.","[""I wish that the punishment was more severe for these fuckwits. Unlike a lot of crimes that you can do accidentally or out of necessity, there's never a good reason to be torturing animals."", '*loads shotgun* I just want to talk to him', ""I'm not a saint so I can confidently say you are, if this is real."", 'I have a Parrot named Michael, he was thrown out a car window not so long ago, and I took very good care of him since then', 'Does everyone in your neighborhood hate animals so much that they would slaughter and abuse any animal on sight?']",2022-11-08T20:01:24Z,@ladycatsinger

"I mentioned a similar story on another video, but in conversation with correctional officers and/or cops, they will talk a lot about how criminals of theft or murder often do things out of desperation or impulsiveness. Many are incredibly aware, remorseful, and accountable for crimes they have committed. Hell, even one correctional guard I spoke to talked about a convicted murderer who would do prison work and charity (education in GED, for example) as he understood the consequence of his actions and felt genuinely bad.

These folks who do this crap to animals are *not* this type of person. They are horribly sick people who have a perspective that life is inferior enough to premeditate pain or torture towards these innocent babies. As some comments below mention, this is psychopathic behavior. I hate how most of these people received pitiful sentences (with some not even having this on a record).

"The thing with animal abuse is that it's often defended with charges being higher for animals we as people like, and vermin and cattle being killed by the hundreds daily, and while there's something to be said for that, I think there's a stark difference between purposefully killing an animal, and abusing/ killing an animal for the hell of it, and even broadcasting it for others to see. There's something profoundly disturbing about intentionally harming something that is completely within your power, and drawing joy from that act, that makes it very different from slaughtering an animal for food or killing it because it threatens your livelihood.

Yeah, sorry. Forgot that I was part of a group that ""disturb"" another, smaller, equally aged group of children that where torturing their pet mouse by throwing it on the pavement or as high as they can with no efforts of catching it either in broad daylight on active streets. 
We thought it was funny to put big china crackers we had left from new year in their back pockets and light them, telling them if they ran, we'd hunt them down another day and held them in place while we light up the fuses. 
Since it was pretty close to new year, it's likely that the mouse was an animal present for the two siblings from Christmas.
We never detonated any fireworks in their pockets sadly.

Walter is a bit more of a gray area. He was also being a dumb kid, but he also inflicted real harm on an animal and didn‚Äôt understand why that was wrong. I am glad that he faced repercussions, so that he could learn his lesson and not hurt animals ever again, but I am also glad it didn‚Äôt give him a permanent criminal record.

I agree that, even though it is horrible that people still drown unwanted puppies in areas like Bosnia, the girl in the video was definitely taking pleasure in it. However I am kind of glad that there were no legal repercussions, since Bosnian law would have punished her parents and it isn‚Äôt necessarily their fault that she turned out like this.

"/b/ lurker from back around those dates when all of this happened. Back then, before the uprising of /pol/, there were a lot of racist jokes going around, but it was at the expense of every race. I still got some really not appropriate memes for the internet of today towards white folks too. It was all for the lolz and not really taking anything serious. But there were 2 things that were absolutely unacceptable for us: CP and animal abuse. I know this is no longer an acceptable therm, but back then it was just what we called: ""The power of weaponized autism"".

If anything, everything and everyone was the expense of a joke; but there was no real malicious intent. When /pol/ went full racist during and after Cheeto Mussolini started his campaign and got elected, and the fallout after; all of us at /b/ were like ""wait... You guys are ACTUALLY racist!?""

But yeah. Thank you so much for making this video. Whilst in /b/ we did dumb shit like spam the Pawn Stars shop asking for a copy of battle toads, or we got people to delete system 32; we also took shit like this seriously.

I honestly kinda miss those mid to late 2000s internet sometimes.

For some reason a lot of morons abandon a lot of cats near our town since its near a wooded place and the poor things wander into town looking for places to seek shelter since they were never raised in the wild. 
About a month and a half ago our family came across a stray kitten living in our neighbors shed (they didnt have a clue this poor little guy was in there taking shelter in their shed as someone had abandoned this poor little guy)  that had a limp & a nasty scar on its chest. Fast foward to now, the little guy is curled up sleeping on my bed as I type this after causing chaos through out the house today. His limp is completely gone & he now has beautiful orange fur covering where that gash would be. His name is Turnip .

"Got a major correction for you, Wavy, regarding the Bosnia puppies situation. That... is not a Russian-speaking area. Serbo-Croatian is the main language there, and I know that since I'm from Serbia. Haven't see the video of the puppers being thrown, but it's very possible that the word she said wasn't Russian either. The word she said could've been ""Ode!"" (There it goes!).
And as for the abuse... yeah, most of us in ex-Yugoslavia don't sterilize our dogs so accidental litters of puppies are a common occurence. Most people get rid of the puppies by leaving them in the fields. Sad, I know, but there isn't a lot of $$$ oftentimes.","['@Fairfax ≈†ta oƒçekivati od amera koji su tradicionalno dezinformisani.

"There‚Äôs a reason that the legal system doesn‚Äôt condone vigilante justice. It‚Äôs one thing to report something that you see to the police or some authority, but stalking is also a crime, stalking a minor and putting their information out there where some perv feels justified in hinting them down and doing despicable things to them isn‚Äôt right either. There are truly insane people out there, yes, some that will hurt animals, but also people that will do awful things to people and even children. You should leave the law to the legal system. It is completely wrong to give out people‚Äôs residential address. And it‚Äôs equally disgusting trying to ruin the entire life of a minor. The brain is not fully developed until the age of 25. Calling attention to someone who needs therapy or legal punishment is one thing, and driving teenagers to suicide or being physically stalked is another. Keep in mind, you‚Äôre not only harassing and ruining the lives of that person, but you‚Äôre hitting the rest of their family as well when they had nothing to do with the action in question. Do not dox children. It‚Äôs predatory in itself and demonstrates your own immoral and immature judgement.

"I haven't seen the Dusty the cat video and have no intention of seeking it out, but assuming the Kenny Glen AMA was indeed the real kid, he said the abuse was 'fake', that he exaggerated his movements and the cat only cried because of the water, but how can that be true? You said he held the cat by the neck and hit it against the wall, even if he barely hit it against the wall, holding a cat by its neck would cause injury, could potentially disable or kill it if any of its vertebrae were dislocated. Also he held its face to a shower head and blasted it with water for an extended time, that's literally torture. There's no way any of that could have been exaggerated or faked.

she didn't however ENJOY it like the person in that video seems to do... 
imo its actually a big problem in Russia, there are no reliable animal shelters at all so people just either kill their animals or throw them out on the street... i hope it changes :( theres enough shit goin on as it is

"To reference the drowning puppy case... it happens all the time in Eastern Europe.  I am from Russia, and it is a very common practice to drown an unwanted litter of puppies or kittens.  Commonly put in a durlap sack, and then drowned.  Slavic countries have done that for centuries because it is cheaper do so than neuter or spade all the stray dogs and cats in the village.  Hell, even in the cities you have packs of feral dogs running around and a ton of stray cats.  A concept that most Americans don't get is that there aren't really any animal welfare laws anywhere else, except maybe Canada, UK, or Australia.  That is why there weren't any legal consequences for Katja. People who don't live in the States barely have any rights themselves, let alone extending rights to animals.  That is why I love living in the USA.  But Jesus Christ, learn a bit about animal welfare laws (or lack thereof) it you are speaking about other countries.  I hate animal abuse as any other normal human being does, and disagree with drownings, but I know what their reasoning for it is.  

P.S.  Also Katja wasn't speaking Russian. It was Bosnian.  Both are Slavic but there are major differences.  It is like if you said Finnish and Norwegian were the same language.",[],2022-10-29T04:44:23Z,@aleksey2905

"About the puppy throwing- this used to be a *very* common way to ""euthanize"" puppies only a few decades ago, especially in rural areas. It was either throw them in a river, drown them in a bucket (filling it with water and putting a lid over it), or freeze them alive. Bullets were often seen as too expensive to be used, and these methods are usually seen as less morally involved than slitting the throat. It's less personal, if that makes sense. Takes a mental weight off of you because you personally did not kill them- it was the river/the bucket/the icebox. Plus you can just put them in and just... leave.

Also swatting is wrong no matter the situation. If anyone does that, I believe you should be charged with wasting Police resources and thrown in jail.

"Many ""normal"" people would be shocked to learn how common it is for children and teens to hurt animals. I know multiple people who've hurt animals, like cats and rats, and it haunts them greatly to this day. It's typically done during ones ""edgy"" faze, or even out of morbid curiosity. I won't disclose their exact experiences, but I will say that a couple of the people I know seemed like they were angry and confused at that time in their lives, and one of them was literally morbidly curious, and it seemed as though he was learning about and grappling with the knowledge of mortality in a sick way without thinking- just an impulsive, isolated event. Some kids do it for the negative attention. Similar to how girls will post provocative, overly sexual things online that paint themselves in a negative light, in search of the wrong kind of attention due to lacking self respect, along with other issues. Or similar to how people will exaggerate stories of bad things they've done because they want people to think, ""woah don't mess with that guy, he's crazy! What a badass!"". Some kids will do something crazy or outlandish on purpose just for whatever type of negative attention they're seeking, often subconsciously. They later will regret it and wonder why and how they could've done such a thing. It's impulsive and childish behavior, thus why it's more common for children and teenagers do it. You should be more worried if an adult does such a thing, there's no excuse for that.
Everyone's got different reasons, but I will say that JUST because someone hurt an animal as a kid, it doesn't mean they are a sociopath, or anything of the sort. In fact, the two people who come to mind have the opposite problem, they grew to become very down to earth people who are way too empathetic.

First, if they were never publicly ridiculed, the chances of them atoning for their crimes is slim to zero. They\'re not sorry that they did it, they\'re sorry they got caught. Second, considering they uploaded themselves acting the crime anyway, tells to me that they are hoping to find people as sick as they are (like the turtle killers that told other people offended by them to ""lighten up""), not even realizing or yet to realize that they\'re just messed up bunch of people. If they were truly sorry, maybe they\'d remove their own video before public backlash? Maybe they\'d turn themselves in? Idk, but if they have enough remorse to do that, I don\'t think they\'d have ever done the crime in the first place. This IS animal abuse we\'re talking about.

Again, the mistake on their part is that they incrimenate themselves. Let me ask you this, how many kids you grew up with (friends, siblings, or total strangers) do the things that these people did? These are sick individuals but society would be willing to overlook it because they are young. You say that because they are young, they have room to grow. I don\'t disagree, but what I was trying to say in my original comment was that these people commited straight evil. Kids can be cruel, but how many of them have we actually branded as evil? ""We all make mistakes"", but calling the intentional act of torturing animals for self pleassure is giving ""mistakes"" too much credit imo.
